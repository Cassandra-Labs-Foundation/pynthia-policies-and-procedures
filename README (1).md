## **Purpose and Objectives** <a href="#purpose-and-objectives" id="purpose-and-objectives"></a>

This policy reaffirms and formalizes the bank’s realization of and respect for the privacy expectations and rights of our customers regarding financial information and other related information, which the bank has or gathers in the normal course of business. It is intended to provide guidance to bank personnel with respect to the physical safeguarding of information, as well as assurance to our customers. The rules apply only to information about individuals. Therefore, the rules do not apply to information about businesses, corporations, partnerships or similar entities. Attempts to identify all customers or signers will be made prior to release of information. We will also, of course, act in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

This policy applies to:

1. Bank employees;
2. Any organization or individual with whom we have a contractual or fiduciary relationship;
3. Information in all forms, including oral, written, image and electronic;
4. Physical and logical (non-physical) protection;
5. All modes of information processing, including, but not limited to, manual methods, hardware and software networks, other devices and information disposal techniques;
6. Information used by the Bank which originates outside including, but not limited to, vendors, contractors, customers, regulators, other enterprises and the public domain; and
7. The Bank’s information resources used by, shared by or in the custody of others.
8. Proper disposal of customer information and consumer information.

NOTE: This statement of scope should not be interpreted to mean that all information resources must be protected equally.

The Bank expects that our processing partners will provide no less a level of customer privacy protection than that provided by the Bank. Conversely, the Bank will make every reasonable effort to apply the required level of customer privacy protection to partner information resources in our custodianship. These agreements should be concluded before accepting information resources from third parties.

## **Definitions** <a href="#definitions" id="definitions"></a>

Employee: For the purpose of this policy, it includes all directors, officers, and employees of the bank as well as any attorneys, agents, or outside vendors, who become privy to customer information.

Consumer: An individual who obtains or has obtained a financial product or service from a bank that is to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or that individual’s legal representative. An example of a consumer would be a loan applicant. A consumer is not necessarily a customer.\
Customer: A person who has established a “continuing relationship” with the bank. (For example, an approved loan applicant who signs a note would become a customer).

Nonpublic personal information: Nonpublic personal information is "personally identifiable financial information that is provided by a consumer to a financial institution, results from any transaction with, or service performed, for the consumer or is otherwise obtained by the financial institution. The rule excludes 'publicly available information' from the definition of nonpublic personal information. Publicly available information is any information that an institution has a reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public from government records, widely distributed media or disclosures to the public required to be made by federal, state or local law. To have a reasonable basis, the institution must determine three things:\
· whether the information is of the type available to the general public,\
· whether an individual may direct that the information not be made available to the general public, and\
· if the individual may so direct, whether he or she has not made the information available."\
An interpretation of this would be any information that is not available to the general public and/or associates a consumer with a particular institution. For example, a customer's name and address are public information, however a customer's name and address associated with a particular financial institution is not (which means the fact that a customer has a relationship with the bank cannot be released to someone else). Financial institutions must protect the information they receive from consumers when that consumer performs any transaction or utilizes any service offered by the financial institution. See sections titled Public Personal Information and section titled Non-public Personal Information for more detail.

Publicly available information: Any information that a bank has a reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records; widely distributed media; or disclosures to the general public that are required to be made by Federal, State, or local law. (For example, a published telephone directory, or the public record of real estate transactions.)

Public Personal Information:\
The following is considered public personal information\
Name\
Address\
Phone #  (listed)\
Existence of a mortgage loan (not to include balance or account # or any other information)\
Property taxes

Non-Public Personal Information (NPPI):\
The following is considered non-public personal information\
Social Security Number\
Assets\
Income\
Liabilities\
Phone # (unlisted)\
Account balances\
Account numbers\
Transaction history\
Parties to a transaction\
Communication with us such as requests for check copies and our response\
Credit worthiness or credit history\
Employment information from outside sources\
Property insurance coverage\
Property Value as determined by an appraisal

Non-Public Personal Information  is protected both for consumers and customers at the same level including former and declined customers or consumers. &#x20;

## **Responsibility** <a href="#responsibility" id="responsibility"></a>

The Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility to appropriately establish and maintain this policy and assure that it is being observed in the daily operations of the bank. The VP- Compliance, BSA & Security is responsible for carrying out this policy and making recommendations to the Board of Directors as to necessary or desirable changes to the policy.

## **Privacy Requests** <a href="#privacy-principles" id="privacy-principles"></a>

**When individuals request information about themselves, whether in writing or verbally, it is considered a privacy request. These requests should be logged and forwarded to the Privacy Officer \[or whomever is in charge of responding to privacy requests].**

## **Privacy Principles** <a href="#privacy-principles" id="privacy-principles"></a>

The bank recognizes the following eight elements of its privacy policy, which have become standard within the banking industry:\
1\. Recognition of Customer’s Expectation of Privacy\
2\. Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information\
3\. Maintenance of Accurate Information\
4\. Limiting Employee Access to Information\
5\. Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures\
6\. Restrictions on the Disclosure of Consumer Information\
7\. Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties\
8\. Disclosure of Privacy Principles to Customers

## **Recognition of Customer’s Expectation of Privacy** <a href="#recognition-of-customers-expectation-of-privacy" id="recognition-of-customers-expectation-of-privacy"></a>

Customers of our bank are entitled to the absolute assurance that the information concerning their financial circumstances and personal lives, which the bank has obtained through various means, will be treated with the highest degree of confidentiality and respect. Certain expectations of privacy also contain legal rights of customers which are either granted or confirmed to them through various federal and state laws and regulations. All employees are directed by this policy to assure customers of the bank’s commitment to preserving the privacy of their information. The bank will post a notice on its Web site, which contains an abbreviated version of this policy. A notice will be given to any potential customer or current customer upon request. Although no longer required, annually the availability of the notice will be sent to current customers, informing them of where they can obtain the privacy notice, along with other notifications via the Bank’s annual mailing. The initial notice is included as part of this policy (Exhibit A) and is designed to be both a posted notice and a direct disclosure to customers under circumstances described later in this policy. Should the Bank’s privacy practices change, the Bank will send a revised notice.

## **Standards of the Administrative, Technical & Physical Safeguards of Customer Information** <a href="#standards-of-the-administrative-technical-and-physical-safeguards-of-customer-information" id="standards-of-the-administrative-technical-and-physical-safeguards-of-customer-information"></a>

Each department will secure information from unauthorized viewers or recipients by keeping open work areas free from customers or consumers’ information when areas are unattended.  This includes removing and securing information on computer terminals, written documents on desks or counters or any other means information may be available to unauthorized persons.

## **Use, Collection and Retention of Consumer Information** <a href="#use-collection-and-retention-of-consumer-information" id="use-collection-and-retention-of-consumer-information"></a>

It is the policy and practice of the bank to collect, retain and use information about consumers and customers (both individual and corporate) only where the bank reasonably believes the gathering of such information would be useful and allowed by law to administer the bank’s business and/or to provide products, services or opportunities to its customers.

## **Maintenance of Accurate Information** <a href="#maintenance-of-accurate-information" id="maintenance-of-accurate-information"></a>

Executive Management is directed to establish procedures to ensure that, to the extent practicable, all customer financial information is accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. The bank will respond promptly and affirmatively to any legitimate customer request to correct inaccurate information, including forwarding of corrected information to any third party who had received the inaccurate information. The bank will further undertake to record that such corrective action was requested by the customer and follow up with any third party to ensure that they have received notice of the required correction.

Procedures to ensure customer records are accurate and regularly updated will be maintained. Every opportunity will be given to customers to correct information held at our bank. All attempts to have changes of information, addition or deletion will be done in writing whenever possible.  Attempts to detect identity theft through unauthorized means will be strictly adhered to.

Change of address requires a written change form, if the change is requested in person and identity has been established the change will be processed. If the request is made by mail, phone or secured email the customer’s identity must be established before the change can be processed and a note will be created in Insight.  If the Bank receives notice from the Post office of a change of address, the address will be changed in Insight and a Red Flag letter will be mailed to the customer. Customers are also able to change their address via the Bank’s online banking platform. All customers who have an address change is mailed a Red Flag Letter.

Change of name will require copies of court document, marriage or divorce documents as well as signed W9 form.

Customers may review their records and make corrections of inaccuracies only after sufficient identification has been made.

All information should be corrected immediately upon notice or upon verification by the bank as needed.  Corrections will be made to the bank’s core computer system whenever possible to ensure all departments have access to the same data.  Employees will access non-public personal information only as needed for processing transactions or inquiries to perform their job related duties at the Bank.

## **Limitation on Employee Access** <a href="#limitation-on-employee-access" id="limitation-on-employee-access"></a>

Executive Management will take all steps necessary to ensure that only employees with a legitimate business reason for knowing personally identifiable customer information shall have access to such information. To the extent practicable, access will be limited by computer access codes and granting limited access to areas in which sensitive customer information is retained. Employees will be informed at the time of their initial employment of these standards through the Bank’s Code of Ethics and Conflict of Interest Policy, and orientation training on privacy of consumer financial information and periodically be reminded of these standards during training sessions at least once during each calendar year. Willful violation of this element of this policy will result in disciplinary action against the offending individual. Inadvertent violations will be dealt with in a manner to ensure that such violations are not repeated.

## **Protection of Information** <a href="#protection-of-information" id="protection-of-information"></a>

The bank will maintain appropriate security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access to customer information. Such procedures should prevent access by not only unauthorized employees, but others as well. Such others include but are not limited to, all non-employees with otherwise legitimate reasons for being on bank premises, computer "hackers" and any intruders on bank premises.\
Unauthorized use of non-public personal information by non-bank employees will be reported under a Suspicious Activity Report and appropriate notification to law enforcement.

Properly disposing of customer information and consumer information\
Customer or consumer NPPI will be safeguarded from unauthorized persons during its use within the bank. This may be by keeping documents in non-public areas or in locked drawers, locked cabinets, locked offices or locked rooms when these areas could be assessable to non-authorized persons. Documents will be retained for the proper retention period as outlined in the bank’s retention schedule and will be destroyed using proper disposal methods either within the bank using shredders or placed in locked shred bins for pick up and disposal by our third party shred/disposal company.

## **Access of information by customers or consumers** <a href="#access-of-information-by-customers-or-consumers" id="access-of-information-by-customers-or-consumers"></a>

Customers or consumers may access their information only after sufficient identification has been made.  When requesting information in person, visual identification documents will be requested; verification of signature against current bank records, and ownership rights will be verified prior to releasing information.

Customers or consumers who request information over the phone may be refused the information and requested to personally appear so identification may be made or if sufficient information may be obtained to verify the identity such as the amount of the last deposit, date of the last deposit, when or at which branch your account was opened or any other information a customer would know but a thief or other unauthorized person would have to guess.

ATM information access requires a customer initiated PIN number and on-line banking requires a username and password as well as other authentication information.  This PIN and/or log-in information is the personal information of the customer and is not to be requested by an employee. &#x20;

## **General Restriction on the Disclosure of Customer Information** <a href="#general-restriction-on-the-disclosure-of-customer-information" id="general-restriction-on-the-disclosure-of-customer-information"></a>

The bank will not, except in cases allowed or required under the law, reveal specific information about customer accounts or other nonpublic personal information to any nonaffiliated third parties unless the customer has been provided the required privacy disclosures and is given the opportunity to decline or "opt out".

## **Incident Response Procedures** <a href="#incident-response-procedures" id="incident-response-procedures"></a>

In the event of a breach of customer or consumer non-public personal information, a report will be submitted to the President of the bank. The President may designate another employee to research and notify the effected customer or consumer of the breach. Refer to the Bank’s Incident Response Plan for additional information.&#x20;

## **Business Relationships with Third Parties** <a href="#business-relationships-with-third-parties" id="business-relationships-with-third-parties"></a>

If the bank is requested to provide personally identifiable information to a third party, from which the consumer has no right to opt out, and that request is in all respects consistent with other elements of this policy, the bank will accede to the request only if the bank believes that the party adheres to similar privacy principles, no less stringent than set forth in this policy, that provide for keeping such information confidential.

The bank will not enter into an agreement with any entity covered under the first category of exceptions, listed below, without first requiring the entity to maintain the confidentiality of the information to at least the same extent that the bank must maintain that confidentiality and limit the third party's use of the information solely to the purposes for which it is disclosed or as otherwise permitted by law.

## **Disclosure of Privacy Principles to Customers** <a href="#disclosure-of-privacy-principles-to-customers" id="disclosure-of-privacy-principles-to-customers"></a>

Disclosure of the privacy notice (Exhibit A for Cornerstone Bank products and Exhibit B for LPL financial products) shall be provided to customers initially. Although no longer required, notice of how to obtain our Privacy Notice will be sent annually on an annual mailing document to all primary account owners. If there are any changes to the current policy, the Bank will send a revised notice to all applicable customers.

The notice may be delivered by hand, by mail, or electronically, as specified in the pertinent banking regulation. If the notice is provided electronically, the consumer must be required to acknowledge receipt as a necessary condition for obtaining a financial product or service.

## **Requests** <a href="#requests" id="requests"></a>

All requests for our Privacy Policy will be provided in person upon request if requested in person.\
If request is by phone, bank will send Privacy Policy within 10 days of the call.

Joint relationships – if two or more consumers jointly obtain a financial product or service we may satisfy the initial, annual, and revised notice requirements by providing one notice to the primary account owner.

## **Exceptions to the Opt Out Requirements for Service Providers and Joint Marketing** <a href="#exceptions-to-the-opt-out-requirements-for-service-providers-and-joint-marketing" id="exceptions-to-the-opt-out-requirements-for-service-providers-and-joint-marketing"></a>

The opt out requirements do not apply if our bank chooses to provide nonpublic personal information about a consumer to a nonaffiliated third party to perform services for the bank or functions on the bank’s behalf, if our bank provides the initial notice as required and enters into a contractual agreement with the third party that requires the third party to maintain the confidentiality of the information to at least the same extent that the bank must maintain that confidentiality and limits the third party’s use of the information solely to the purposes for which it is disclosed or as otherwise permitted by law.

## **Exceptions to the Opt Out Requirements for Processing and Servicing Transactions** <a href="#exceptions-to-the-opt-out-requirements-for-processing-and-servicing-transactions" id="exceptions-to-the-opt-out-requirements-for-processing-and-servicing-transactions"></a>

There are additional exceptions to the "opt out" requirements. The requirements for initial notice, for opt out, and for service providers and joint marketing do not apply when a bank discloses nonpublic personal information in the following circumstances:\

The Board of Directors of the Bank shall use this policy as their training of the regulation and our Bank’s general procedures to comply.  Any additional requests for training or clarifications will be provided by the Bank’s VP- Compliance, BSA & Security if requested.

## **Record Keeping and Reporting** <a href="#record-keeping-and-reporting" id="record-keeping-and-reporting"></a>
