**General Policy Statement:**  
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Department of the Treasury, is responsible for administering and enforcing a series of laws that impose economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign governments, individuals, groups and entities in accordance with national security and foreign policy goals and objectives. Any transactions, such as transfers of funds, to or from these countries or to blocked persons are prohibited. (Credit Union) is required to block such transfers and accounts and to furnish reports on all blocked accounts and rejected funds transfers to OFAC. This policy is adopted in order to ensure compliance with applicable OFAC requirements. The Credit Union employs a risk-based approach to their OFAC Sanctions Compliance Program.  It has developed, implemented, and routinely updates the sanctions compliance program which is based on the Credit Union’s size and complexity, products and services, customers and geographic locations.

1. **COMPREHENSIVE OFAC SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. **Management and members of the Board of Directors of the Credit Union support the Credit Union’s commitment to the success of its OFAC Sanctions Compliance Program. Adequate resources and support will be provided to ensure the Credit Union creates and administers a comprehensive compliance program that is routinely updated based on the Credit Union’s size and complexity, products and services, customers, and geographic locations. In addition to Management’s commitment under the Culture of Compliance, the program will consist of the following:  
       
   1. **Designate a Compliance Officer.** The Credit Union will designate a “Compliance Officer” who will be responsible for monitoring OFAC compliance, overseeing blocked funds, and ensuring that appropriate staff training is provided. The Compliance Officer will also be responsible for ensuring that the names of persons and entities will be compared to the OFAC Sanctions Lists on a basis.  
         
   2. **Operations and Systems Managers.** The Credit Union may assign formal compliance responsibilities to operations and systems managers. The Credit Union’s internal auditing department will assist in the development of systems and audits to verify that OFAC policies and procedures, once established, are followed.  
         
   3. **Disseminate Information and Provide Training.** The Credit Union will provide sufficient information to key staff members in all operations to enable them to recognize and stop suspect transactions. The account representatives and platform staff are the Credit Union’s first line of defense. Thus, account officers and those individuals responsible for letters of credit and wire transfers will receive special training. These key staff will be trained to remain aware of the persons and entities on the Sanctions List so that accounts and transactions with regards to those persons are blocked and reported to OFAC. Staff will be trained to effectively identify, interdict, escalate, and report to appropriate personnel within the organization transactions and activity that may be prohibited by OFAC.  
         
   4. **Risk Assessment – Initial Review.** The Credit Union will conduct a comprehensive initial review of its operation in order to ensure that OFAC requirements are being met. This will include, but not be limited to, a review of the following procedures:  
          
      1. Processing electronic fund transfers;  
      2. Processing Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) transactions;  
      3. Cashing or depositing share drafts or checks;  
      4. Opening new accounts;  
      5. Issuing of money orders, traveler’s checks and cashier’s checks;  
      6. Disbursing loan proceeds;  
      7. Accepting of loan payments;  
      8. Reviewing the names of co-signors, guarantors, collateral owners and other parties to each transaction;  
      9. Sending and accepting wire transfers;  
      10. Opening and allowing access to safe deposit boxes;  
      11. Issuing credit cards;  
      12. Reviewing the names of joint account owners, beneficiaries and other parties who have an interest in property (i.e., personal representatives and those granted power of attorney).  
             
   5. **Risk Assessment – Ongoing Review.** The Credit Union will review new products and services offered by the Credit Union to ensure that OFAC requirements are met.  
         
   6. **Annual Audit.** The Compliance Officer will work with the Credit Union’s internal and/or external auditors to develop appropriate systems and audits to test the Credit Union is in compliance with this policy.   
         
   7. **Internal Controls.** The Credit Union will outline clear expectations, define policies, procedures and processes pertaining to OFAC compliance and to minimize risks identified by the Credit Union's risk assessments.  
         
2. **DETECTION AND VERIFICATION OF PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS.**  
   ** ** 

   1. **OFAC Sanctions Lists.** The Credit Union will comply with all FinCEN requirements to review potential members, current members, new accounts, existing accounts, and all transactions against all OFAC Sanctions Lists. These lists change regularly in response to changes in foreign policy. The Credit Union’s staff shall be aware of the persons and entities on the lists and ensure that such accounts and transactions are blocked or rejected as required and reported to OFAC in compliance with OFAC regulations.  
         
   2. **Software.** The Credit Union will purchase available software to screen and “interdict” illicit funds transfers. Such software may filter and contain every name on OFAC lists along with generic words for countries and cities. If feasible, the Credit Union will use such software. If interdiction software is not purchased, the Credit Union will use good faith manual and electronic compliance efforts to comply with OFAC requirements.  
         
   3. **Verification**. Prior to blocking or rejecting a transaction, the Credit Union will take reasonable steps to verify that the individual, country or organization detected is in fact the individual, country or organization subject to OFAC restriction, including contacting the OFAC Compliance Hotline (https://ofac.treasury.gov/ofac-compliance-hotline) to verify that blocking or rejecting the transaction of an individual, country or organization is appropriate.  
       

2. **BLOCKING AND REJECTING TRANSACTIONS.** The Credit Union will create a system whereby all blocked and rejected transactions will be reported to OFAC.  
     

   1. **Blocked Accounts and Transactions. **On reasonable assurance that a transaction or account should be blocked, the Credit Union staff will place a block on the transaction or account. Credit Union staff who place such a block will immediately notify the Compliance Officer of the facts and circumstances surrounding the placement of the block.  
        

      1. **Holding Blocked Funds.** All blocked funds will be placed in a segregated, interest-bearing account, which will be subject to any routine service charges assessed to accounts of a similar type.
