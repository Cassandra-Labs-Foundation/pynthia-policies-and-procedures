Note: While CU PolicyPro does not contain a Cybersecurity Policy per se, Policies 4120 and 4125 used together fulfill cybersecurity policy expectations. It is also important to note that Policy 4120 is more than a cybersecurity policy, in that it includes physical security and other, non-‘cyber’ security considerations. *Policy 2225 – Digital Banking* also includes additional safeguards for protecting the Credit Union’s information systems such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and encryption standards.  
**Model Policy Revised Date: 12/24/2024**  
**General Policy Statement:**  
(Credit Union) recognizes its responsibility to safeguard member information and will treat the private financial information of Credit Union's members ("member information") with appropriate care to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and security of member information. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the guidelines for management and staff to use in establishing and maintaining policies and procedures to safeguard member information. The Credit Union will comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing the safeguarding of member information including NCUA Guidelines for Safeguarding Member Information (12 CFR Part 748 Appendices A and B, Part 749 Appendix B) (the "Guidelines") and all other applicable laws and regulations regarding the safeguarding of member information.  
**Reference:**  
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Special Publication 800-53 (Revision 5\) Security Controls and Assessment Procedures for Federal Information Systems and NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0).

1. **POLICY AND PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITY.**   
       
   1. **Board Responsibility.** This Information Security Policy ("Policy") and any recommended changes shall be approved by the Board of Directors ("Board"). The Board may delegate its oversight responsibility to a Board Committee. The Board will appoint a for the Credit Union on an basis.  
         
   2. **Management Responsibility.** Credit Union Management ("Management") through an Information Security Committee ("Committee") will be responsible for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Credit Union's Information Security Program ("Program") and may assign these responsibilities. Management shall ensure that capital planning and investment requests include the resources needed to implement the information security program.  
         
2. **ASSESSMENT OF RISK.** From time to time, but at least once every 12 months, Management will identify and assess the risks that may threaten the security, confidentiality, or integrity of the Credit Union's information systems, and determine the sensitivity of member information, and the internal and external physical and cybersecurity threats to its security. Also consistent with Policy 2225 – Digital Banking, management will evaluate and adjust its risk assessment periodically and in light of any relevant changes in technology; changes in internal and external threats; changes in the member base adopting electronic banking; changes in member functionality offered through electronic banking; transactional capability; transaction volumes; and actual incidents of security breaches, identity theft, fraud, and other significant cybersecurity events experienced by the Credit Union or industry. Management shall report the annual risk assessment, accompanied by recommendations for mitigation strategies, to the Credit Union’s Board and/or Supervisory Committee for approval.  
      
3. **RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS.** Management will conduct an initial and ongoing risk management analysis of its controls, policies, and procedures to proactively prevent, detect, and respond to all identified risks and intrusions that may occur. The scope of the risk management analysis will cover physical facilities controls, cybersecurity controls including access controls, internal controls, ongoing monitoring of risk and controls, an incident response plan (IRP), and a disaster recovery plan (DRP).   
       
   1. **Assessment of Controls.** Management will assess the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, and other arrangements in place to control risks and reduce risk exposure. The Credit Union will review controls on employee duties and existing incident detection systems from time to time.  
         
   2. **Vulnerability Testing.** The Credit Union will establish a baseline of current assessed risk. The Credit Union will conduct vulnerability testing (at least annually) and may engage outside security expertise to assist in such testing. The results of the vulnerability testing will be given to the Committee (and the Board) for review and necessary action.  
         
   3. **Threat Awareness.** Management shall regularly monitor information security threat alerts from threat-sharing sources, which may include but are not limited to the following: the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, reputable news sources, Credit Union peers, CISA.gov, and service providers. Information gleaned from these sources shall be incorporated into the Credit Union’s ongoing risk management efforts. For example, a newly identified threat to an information system asset used to process member information may increase the risk level associated with that information system above acceptable levels.  
         
   4. **Threat Intelligence and Information Sharing.** The Credit Union may also share information regarding information security incidents to federal and/or federally-sponsored resources such as the National Credit Union Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (NCU-ISAO), Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), InfraGard, Cyber Information Sharing and Collaboration Program (CISCP), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), etc.  
         
   5. **Plan of Action and Milestones.** Management will respond to identified information security risks with documentation of the plans of action to address unacceptable risks, including clear milestones outlining goals and timelines to achieve acceptable risk levels. Plan of action and milestones reports will be given to the Committee (and the Board) for review and approval.  
         
4. **SERVICE PROVIDERS.** Consistent with the Credit Union’s Vendor Due Diligence & Oversight policy, management will require its service providers, by contract, to implement appropriate measures designed to protect against unauthorized access to or use of member information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any member. To that end, the credit union will receive assurances that third parties will handle member information in a manner commensurate with regulatory guidance and the Credit Union’s information security policies and expectations.  
      
5. **SECURITY OF PHYSICAL FACILITIES.**  
       
   1. **Physical Access Authorizations.** Access to locations containing member information is restricted to people with "need-to-know" access to member information. Management shall maintain a list of employees who have physical access to media storage containing member information, or information systems that store, process, or transmit member information. The list shall be reviewed on a Credit Union-defined frequency. Management shall issue credentials for access to facilities based on the physical access authorization process.  
         
   2. **Physical Access Control.** Management shall control access to non-public Credit Union facilities using Credit Union-defined physical access control devices/systems (e.g. physical locks, key card readers). An inventory of access control devices/systems shall be maintained. A procedure will be established to revoke or disable key cards when employees are transferred or separated.  
         
   3. **Monitoring Physical Access.** The Credit Union shall monitor physical access to areas where the information system resides using access logs. The Credit Union will monitor intrusion alarm systems and surveillance cameras.  
         
   4. **Visitor Control.** Visitors to the Credit Union without a "need-to-know" authorization will be escorted as necessary within the nonpublic and administrative areas of the Credit Union, and off-site storage areas by a Credit Union employee with "need-to-know" authorization. Credit Union employees will maintain logs of visitor access to non-public Credit Union areas. All Credit Union employees are required to obtain verbal confirmation of all visitors requesting access to secure spaces from a Credit Union sponsor. Email will not be accepted as visitor authorization.  
         
   5. **Physical and Environmental Protections for Information Systems.** The following controls shall be deployed, as feasible, to protect the Credit Union’s on-premise information systems from physical and environmental threats:   
      1. Emergency power shut-off capability (easily accessible to authorized personnel)  
      2. Automatic emergency lighting  
      3. Fire protection and detection devices  
      4. Temperature and humidity controls  
      5. Water damage protection (accessible and functional master shutoff or isolation valves)  
      6. Additional controls may be deployed, as necessary   
   6. **Staff Controls for Information Handling.**  
          
      1. **Preventing Inadvertent Disclosure.** Credit Union staff who handle member information ("Users") will take all necessary steps to ensure that member information is not inadvertently disclosed to people who do not have a "need-to-know" authorization. When not in use, or when not under direct visual supervision, member information must be stored in a secure storage area such as a locked vault, a cabinet, or a locked desk. Reproduction of member information is permitted only as necessary to perform required work.  
            
      2. **Transport.** Physical transport of member information will require the use of a trusted courier such as internal mail staff, the US Postal Service, UPS, Federal Express, or a contracted courier service. All member information and documents sent via such couriers must be enclosed in an opaque and sealed envelope. Whenever member information is sent over external computer networks, it must be sent in encrypted form.  
            
      3. **Destruction.** When member information is no longer required (but the computers will be used elsewhere), and when legal or regulatory requirements for its retention no longer apply, it must be destroyed according to approved methods as authorized by . **Destruction will include rendering the information unreadable and include complete eradication of residual electronic information required by FACTA and other applicable laws and regulations to be destroyed. The Credit Union will ensure that all contracts between the Credit Union and service providers who have access to or store member information will include contractual requirements that the service provider disposes of member information in a manner consistent with FACTA and other applicable laws and regulations.** The Credit Union will ensure that vital records will not be destroyed.  
            
   7. **Theft Protection.** All Credit Union computers and network equipment must be physically secured with anti-theft devices if located in an open office environment. Local area network servers must be placed in locked cabinets, locked closets, or locked computer rooms. Transportable computers must be placed in locked cabinets or secured via other locking systems when in the office but not in use. Computer and network gear may not be removed from Credit Union offices unless the User has first obtained permission from .  
         
6. **CONTROLS FOR ACCESS SECURITY.**  
       
   1. **Responsibilities of Information Supervisor, Custodians, and Users.**  
          
      1. **Supervisor.** The Information Supervisor or her/his delegate(s) within the Credit Union, bears the responsibility for the acquisition, development, and maintenance of production applications that process member information. For each type of member information, the Supervisor will determine the critical nature of the information, define which Users will be permitted to access it, and define its authorized uses.  
            
      2. **Custodian.** A Custodian is a Credit Union staff person who is in physical or logical possession of member information. The following departments and staff positions are considered Custodians: . Whenever member information is maintained on a personal computer, that User is also the Custodian. A Custodian is responsible for safeguarding member information and maintaining security measures defined by the Supervisor.  
            
      3. **Users.** Users are responsible for complying with any Credit Union member information security policy, procedure, and standard. Questions about the appropriate handling of a specific type of member information should be directed to either the member information Custodian or the Supervisor.   
            
   2. **Member Information Classification and Confidentiality.**  
          
      1. **Information Sensitivity Classification.** Member information is generally designated as nonpublic and may be disclosed only to people authorized to receive it. Authorization is granted by the Supervisor, consistent with the Credit Union's Privacy Policy, and otherwise on a "need-to-know" basis. Unless specified otherwise by the CEO, all Credit Union employees have access and "need-to-know" authorization for member information.  
            
      2. **Password Complexity**. The Credit Union will require members utilizing the Credit Union’s Internet-based services to use several controls to appropriately authenticate members' access to Credit Union products, services and systems as outlined in Policy 2225 – Digital Banking.  
            
      3. **Default Classification.** Member information will be classified and treated as nonpublic, as per the definition of member information in NCUA guidelines (Appendix A to Part 748).  
            
      4. **Disclosure.** Disclosure of member information to any staff person or nonaffiliated third party without a "need-to-know" authorization is prohibited. Employees must be familiar with and agree to the confidentiality provisions and member information security provisions in the Credit Union’s Employee Handbook. Member information Custodians must verify the existence of a signed confidentiality agreement before disclosure to non-employees.   
            
   3. **System Access Controls.** The Credit Union will create system access controls to restrict access to and safeguard member information that is collected and stored by the Credit Union.  
          
      1. **Employees.** The Credit Union will use pre-employment background checks and employment job descriptions to address employee access to member information, dual controls/segregation, and duties for processing transactions and handling member information. Employees may require rescreening, as necessary, when their job duties change and include increased information handling and/or security responsibilities  
            
      2. **Passwords.** Password controls will be implemented to limit system access to member information. Passwords may not be stored in computers without access control systems, written down and left where unauthorized people might discover them, or in other locations where unauthorized people might discover them. Passwords may not be shared or revealed to anyone else besides the authorized user. Passwords will be constructed consistent with Policy 2225 – Digital Banking.  
            
   4. **Access Control System Design.**  
          
      1. **Internal Network Connections.** All Credit Union computers connected to internal computer networks will have an approved password-based access control system. All computers handling member information will employ approved password-based access control systems.  
            
      2. **External Network Connections.** All inbound connections to Credit Union computers from external networks must be protected with an approved dynamic password access control system. Employees must not establish external, internal, intranet, or extranet network connections to the Credit Union’s network without the specific approval of a systems administrator.  
            
      3. **Boot Protection and Screen Savers.** All computer users will obtain boot protection through a fixed password and a screen saver. Multi-user Credit Union systems must employ automatic log-out systems that terminate a user's session after a certain period of inactivity.  
            
      4. **Unique User IDs and Passwords.** All critical access control systems must utilize user IDs and passwords unique to each User, to protect Users from unwarranted suspicion associated with computer crime and abuse and to help maintain the integrity of member information by reducing unexplained errors and omissions.  
            
      5. **Unsuccessful Logon Attempts.** Critical access control systems will be configured to allow only a Credit Union-defined number of failed login attempts to authenticate a user (over a defined timespan) before the account automatically locks for a defined timespan or until it is unlocked by a systems administrator.  
            
      6. **Asset Inventory**: The CU will maintain an inventory of all physical and digital assets, including hardware, software, and data repositories to ensure proper oversight and management.   
            
   5. **Managing System Privileges.**  
          
      1. **Access Requests.** Requests for new user IDs and changed privileges must be in writing and approved by the User’s manager before a Systems Administrator fulfills these requests.   
            
      2. **Compliance and Confidentiality Statement/Agreement.** All Users wishing to use Credit Union multi-user computer systems must sign a compliance and confidentiality agreement before being issued a user ID.  
            
      3. **Access Denial.** All user IDs inactive for  or more days will automatically have the associated privileges suspended or revoked. When Users are transferred to a different job, their system privileges will be changed to reflect their new job duties. At employment separation, all Credit Union property in the employee's possession must be returned to the Credit Union, and all system access privileges shall be terminated. Management reserves the right to revoke the system privileges of any User at any time.  
            
      4. **Prohibited Activities.** Users must not test or attempt to compromise Credit Union computer or communication system security measures unless specifically approved in advance and in writing by the . Incidents involving unapproved system cracking (hacking), password cracking (guessing), file decryption, bootleg software copying, short-cuts bypassing system security measures, pranks or practical jokes, or similar unauthorized attempts to compromise security measures may be unlawful and will be considered serious violations of this Policy.  
            
7. **CONTROLS FOR INTERNAL SECURITY. **  
       
   1. **Standards.** The is responsible for setting standards of conduct for Credit Union employees and Users of member information including compliance with the provisions of this Policy and all member information security procedures conveyed to them verbally or in writing.  
         
   2. **Dual Controls.** Configuration or setting changes for any information security systems or controls, e.g., firewall and other monitoring systems, or any other elements of the Credit Union's Information System that could directly affect member information are made by the , or outsourced service provider, only with express written permission by the .   
         
   3. **Display of Information**. All computer display screens must be positioned such that the information cannot be readily viewed through a window, by people walking in a hallway, or by people waiting in reception and related areas.   
         
   4. **Encryption.** When member information is transmitted over any communication network provided by an organization outside the Credit Union, it must be sent in encrypted form. Member information entrusted to the Credit Union by a third party must be encrypted when sent over external network systems. *(Best practice is for all data at rest and in transit to be encrypted using AES-256 or an equivalent standard, adhering to NIST-approved practices.)*  
         
   5. **Layered Security**. Segregating public and private networks, deploying overlapping controls for access and asset protection  
         
   6. **Held in Storage.** Whenever member information is not actively used, it must be stored in encrypted form if unauthorized individuals can access it.  
         
   7. **Permissible Methods.** Encryption of member information at rest (in storage) or in transit (on a network) must be achieved via commercially available products approved by the . All encryption algorithms, modes of operation, and key management systems must be consistent with internal standards issued by the .  
         
   8. **Information Loss.** Whenever encryption is used, employees must not delete the sole readable version of the member information unless they have first demonstrated that the decryption process can reestablish a readable version of the member information.  
         
   9. **Encryption Keys.** Encryption keys used for member information are always classified as member information. Access to such keys must be strictly limited to those who have "need-to-know" authorization. Likewise, encryption keys must always be encrypted when sent over a network.  
         
   10. **Broadcast Systems.** Portable phones using radio technology as well as cellular phones must not be used for data transmissions containing member information unless the connection is encrypted. Likewise, other broadcast networking technologies, such as radio-based local area networks or wireless (“wi-fi”) networks, must not be used for member information unless the link is encrypted.  
          
   11. **Network Changes.** Except for emergency situations, all changes to Credit Union computer networks must be documented in a work order request and approved in advance by the . Emergency changes to the Credit Union networks may be made only by people authorized by the . Change management policy details are described the Configuration Management Policy (See Policy 4305).  
          
   12. **New Systems Set-Up.** Employees must not establish external, internal, intranet, or extranet network connections to the Credit Union’s network without the specific approval of the .   
          
   13. **Systems Removal and Disposal**. Computer Equipment with an internal disk drive(s) (“hard drive”) being removed for relocation or disposal must have the disk drive(s) render any information unreadable. Devices with hard drives containing member data may also include multi-function copiers/scanners/printers. If the equipment is being relocated to another Credit Union user, the disk drive(s) may be erased using software specifically designed to render any data on the disk drive(s) unusable. Data erasure must meet minimum Department of Defense (DOD) guidelines. If the equipment is being discarded, sold, or given away, the disk drive(s) must be removed and physically destroyed before removal. If data destruction is performed by a third party, destruction must be performed on-site with Credit Union supervision and a certificate of destruction should be issued by the third party.  
          
   14. **Application Development.** All software development and software maintenance activities performed by in-house staff must subscribe to a Software Development Life Cycle framework, and adhere to the Credit Union’s Information System policies, standards, procedures, and systems development conventions regarding testing, training, and documentation  
           
       1. **Written Specifications.** All software developed by in-house employees, and intended to process critical, valuable, member information, must have a written formal specification, which includes a discussion of both security risks and controls (including access control systems and contingency plans).   
             
       2. **Security Sign-Off Required.** Before being used for production processing, new or substantially changed application systems must have received written approval from the .  
             
       3. **Formal Change Control.** All computer and communications systems used for production processing at the Credit Union must employ a documented change control process.  
             
   15. **Handling Security Information.** Information about security measures for Credit Union computer and network systems is confidential and may not be released to people not possessing "need-to-know" access.  
          
   16. **User Training**. Employees will receive recurring cybersecurity training. Quarterly phishing simulations will be conducted to enhance employee awareness of social engineering tactics and measure readiness. Additionally, the CU should consider specialized training for any user in a high-risk role, such as an IT administrator.   
          
8. **INCIDENT DETECTION. **The Committee is responsible for the compilation, regular maintenance, and annual testing of contingency plans for all Credit Union information systems, including the creation of an Incident Response Plan and coordination of an Incident Response Team. This Team is mobilized in the event of a hacker intrusion, a virus infection, and other security-related events. The Credit Union shall also ensure that its contracts with service providers require the service providers to disclose any information regarding any breach of security resulting from unauthorized intrusion into the credit union’s member information system maintained by the service provider.   
       
   1. **Actions Taken in the Event of an Incident. **In the event of an incident, the Credit Union will undertake the following actions as soon as possible:  
          
      1. Assess the nature and scope of the incident and identify each member information system and types of member information that have been accessed or misused;  
            
      2. Notify the appropriate authorities as set forth below in the Response Program;  
            
      3. Take prompt and appropriate measures to prevent further unauthorized access or use of member information which may or may not include monitoring, freezing or closing affected accounts if feasible and appropriate, while preserving records and other evidence;  
            
      4. Notify members when such notice is warranted and per the Guidance and notice format promulgated by the NCUA/FTC;   
            
      5. Take appropriate and prompt corrective measures: and  
            
      6. Complete annual incident response tabletop exercises that will simulate real-world scenarios to evaluate readiness and refine the Incident Response Plan.   
            
   2. **Preventing Computer Viruses and Similar Intrusions**. A computer virus may cause slower computer response time, inexplicable loss of files, changed modification dates for files, increased file sizes, and total failure of Credit Union's computers.  
          
      1. **Screening Programs Enabled.** To ensure continued uninterrupted service, for individual computers and networks, all computer Users must keep current versions of approved virus screening software enabled on their computers and not bypass the scanning process. If possible, approved virus screening software shall be centrally managed by authorized Credit Union personnel.  
            
      2. **Eradication Process.** If Users suspect infection by a computer virus, they must immediately stop using the infected computer and contact the .   
            
      3. **Clean Back-Ups.** To assist with the post-virus-infection restoration of normal microcomputer activities, all computer software must be copied before its initial usage, and such copies must be stored in a secure location.  
            
      4. **Software Sources.** To prevent problems with viruses, and Trojan horses, Credit Union computers and networks must not run software that comes from sources other than those approved by the Information Systems Manager or other authorized person at the Credit Union.  
            
   3. **Disaster Recovery.** The Credit Union will take whatever measures necessary to protect against the destruction, loss, or damage of member information due to potential environmental hazards, such as fire and water damage or technical failures and outside intrusions.  
          
      1. These measures shall include the development of a disaster recovery plan to prepare for catastrophic acts. The Credit Union will evaluate potential threats, establish business impact levels, and determine critical systems and necessary resources through ongoing risk assessment activities. The disaster recovery plan will include the following information and procedures, at minimum:   
         1. roles and responsibilities;  
         2. record preservation methods;  
         3. alternate storage and processing site provisions;  
         4. alternate telecommunications service provisions;  
         5. communication methods for employees and members; and,  
         6. notification of applicable regulators.  
      2. Management will train employees in their roles and responsibilities in the disaster recovery plan. The Credit Union will test contingency and disaster recovery assumptions annually. The test results will be documented and reported to Credit Union officials. Disaster recovery and contingency plans will be coordinated with the Credit Union’s risk assessment and incident response plan. The disaster recovery plan will be documented and submitted to the Board and/or Supervisory Committee for approval.  
            
      3. **Back-Up Responsibility and Schedules.** To protect the Credit Union's information systems/facilities from loss or damage, the is responsible for making periodic back-ups. All critical member information resident on Credit Union computer systems and networks must be periodically backed-up. The will define which member information and which programs/systems are to be backed-up, the frequency of back-up, the type of back-up, and the method of back-up. Secure storage of back-up media is the responsibility of the . Storage media from multi-user systems must be stored in fireproof safes, at a separate location at least several city blocks away from the system being backed-up and physically protected against unauthorized access.  
            
   4. **Monitoring.** Management will be responsible for regularly monitoring its information systems for detection of any intrusions. Computer systems handling member information must securely log all significant computer security relevant events. The , or person designated by the , will monitor and review system logs in real time, at least daily, and will implement a real time alert mechanism. Log records will contain information that establishes what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the event. Logs containing computer security relevant events must be retained for at least months. During this period, logs may be accessible only by authorized people.  
         
9. **RESPONSE PROGRAM. **Management will be responsible for developing and implementing a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to member information, according to the Credit Union’s Incident Response Policy **(See Policy 4125). **This includes Cyber Incident Reporting as required under NCUA Regulations Part 748\.  
     

   1. **Cyber Incident Report**. The Credit Union will notify the NCUA via email, telephone, or other similar method of a reportable cyber incident as soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after the possible reportable cyber incident is believed to have occurred.  
       

2. **CREDIT UNION SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES USE POLICY.**  
       
   1. **Off-Site Physical Security.** At alternative worksites, reasonable precautions should be taken to protect Credit Union hardware, software, and member information from theft, damage, and misuse. The Credit Union maintains the right to conduct inspections of telecommuter offices with one or more days advance notice. All employees who keep member information at their homes to do Credit Union work must have furniture, which can be locked, for the proper storage of this information. Telecommuter employees will have adequate means to communicate with Credit Union response personnel in the event of security incidents.  
          
      1. **Off-Site Systems.** Computer systems provided by the Credit Union may **not** be modified in any way without the knowledge and authorization of the . Similarly, employees may not bring their home computers into the office to process member information without prior approval from the . Employees in the possession of portable, laptop, notebook, palmtop, and other transportable computers containing member information must not leave these computers unattended at any time.  
            
      2. **Removable Storage Media.** Whenever member information is written to a removable media, the storage media must be marked. When not in use, this media must be locked in a safe, furniture, or a similarly secured location. Member information stored on removable storage media will be encrypted.  
            
      3. **Removal of Information.** Member information may not be removed from Credit Union premises unless there has been prior approval from the . This policy includes member information stored on portable computer hard disks, removable media, hard-copy output, paper memos, and the like.
