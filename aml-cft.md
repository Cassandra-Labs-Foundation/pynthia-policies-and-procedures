&#x20;(Credit Union) comprehensive Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program will include internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), the BSA, the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, OFAC rules, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, and all related laws and regulations in order to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and other financial crimes.\
**Definitions:**

1. **Money Laundering**. Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing “dirty” money through a series of transactions in order to “clean” the funds so that they appear to be proceeds from legal activities. It may not involve currency (cash) at every stage of the laundering process, and generally involves three independent steps (that can occur at the same time):\
   &#x20;
   1. **Placement**: Structuring currency deposits in amounts to evade reporting requirements, or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal activities. Examples:\
      &#x20;
      1. Large number of deposits below the reporting threshold.\
         &#x20;
      2. Depositing a refund check from a canceled vacation package or insurance policy.\
         &#x20;
      3. Buying a series of monetary instruments that are collected and deposited at another location.\
         &#x20;
   2. **Layering**: Moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions. Examples:\
      &#x20;
      1. Exchanging monetary instruments for larger or smaller amounts.\
         &#x20;
      2. Wiring or transferring funds to and through numerous accounts in one or more financial institutions.\
         &#x20;
   3. **Integration**: Creating the appearance of legality through additional transactions. Example:\
      &#x20;
      1. The purchase and resale of real estate or other assets.\
         &#x20;
2. **Terrorist Financing**. Activities financing a terrorist organization are often funded through legitimate sources, such as: (1) charitable donations; (2) business ownership; and/or (3) personal employment.

**Guidelines:**

The risk assessment will be performed at least every 12 to 18 months.\
      &#x20;
   3. **Internal Controls**. The Compliance Officer will develop and implement a system of internal controls and procedures under the oversight of the . The Credit Union’s internal controls consist of monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping. \

This program will be risk-based and will allow the Credit Union to understand the nature and purpose of the member relationship. \
      &#x20;
   2. \*\*High Risk Members. \*\*For high risk members, the Credit Union will obtain the following information at account opening and throughout the relationship:\

          &#x20;
   3. **Correspondent and Private Banking Accounts**.  The PATRIOT Act requires enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to detect and report money laundering or potential terrorist activities conducted through correspondent accounts for foreign banks or through private banking accounts (For the purposes of the PATRIOT Act, a “private banking” account is one in which the Credit Union requires a minimum balance of at least $1,000,000 and is managed by a specific Credit Union employee). \
      &#x20;
   4. **Money Service Businesses (MSBs).** MSBs include any person doing business, regardless of whether on a regular basis, in one or more of the following: money orders, travelers checks, money transmissions, check cashing and currency dealing or exchange. Must conduct more than $1,000 in business with one person in one or more transactions on any one day (however, NO activity threshold applies to money transmitters).\
      &#x20;
      1. When opening an account for an entity, the Credit Union will at a minimum, conduct the following due diligence for MSBs:\
         &#x20;
         1. Apply the Credit Union’s CIP/MIP;\
            &#x20;
         2. Confirm whether it has registered with FinCEN (as it is required to do every two (2) years. If not, the account will not be opened);\
            &#x20;
         3. Confirm whether it is licensed to do business in the state (If not, the account will not be opened);\
            &#x20;
         4. Conduct a basic BSA/AML risk assessment to determine the level of risk associated with the account and whether further due diligence is necessary.\
            &#x20;
      2. To reduce and mitigate the risk imposed by MSB members, the Credit Union may pursue some or all of the following actions as part of the due diligence:
         1. Review the MSB’s BSA/AML program;
         2. Review results of the MSB’s independent testing of its AML program;
         3. Review written procedures for the operation of the MSB;
         4. Conduct on-site visits;
         5. Review list of agents, including locations, within or outside the US, which will be receiving services directly or indirectly through the MSB account;
         6. Determine whether the MSB has performed due diligence on third-party servicers or paying agents;
         7. Review written agent management and termination practices for the MSB;
         8. Review written employee screening practices for the MSB.
      3. The Credit Union will review [FinCEN’s website](https://www.fincen.gov/msb-registrant-search) (https://www.fincen.gov/msb-registrant-search) to determine whether an MSB required to register has, in fact, registered or renewed its registration.
   5. **Legal Entity Members.** The Credit Union will identify and verify legal entity members, including all beneficial owners, consistent with the CIP/MIP. The Credit Union will identify the beneficial owners of each legal entity at the time a new account is opened by obtaining a certification, similar to the Customer Due Diligence Certification Form, Appendix A or another method, provided the individual completing the form certifies (to the best of their knowledge) that the information is accurate. The Credit Union may access beneficial ownership information through a database established by FinCEN.  If accessing the FinCEN database, the Credit Union will follow their corresponding procedures to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations. The Credit Union will update beneficial ownership information on their members on an event-driven basis, when in normal course monitoring they detect information that may be relevant, such as a potential change in the ownership structure or unexplained change in activity.
      1. **Beneficial owners** as listed above, means each individual who directly or indirectly (through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise) owns 25% or more of the equity interests of the legal entity and a single individual with significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct the legal entity (e.g., CEO, CFO, COO, General Partner, etc.). If a Trust is an owner, the beneficial owners would be the Trustee(s).
      2. Unless otherwise excluded, **legal entity**, as used above, includes a corporation, limited liability company, or other entity created by the filing of a public document with a Secretary of State or similar office, a general partnership, and any similar entity formed under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction.&#x20;
   6. **Monitoring System**. The Credit Union will monitor activity through a system. The Credit Union will ensure, as part of the monitoring process, that it maintains current information about its members. It will conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and will update member information on an as-needed basis, based on risk-based procedures.\
      &#x20;
4. **REPORTING**\
   &#x20;
   1. **CURRENCY TRANSACTION REPORT (CTR).** The Credit Union will complete and electronically file a FinCEN CTR, each time a nonexempt member withdraws, transfers, makes a payment with, or deposits cash (currency or coin) of more than $10,000 within 15 days of the transaction. Multiple transactions by or on behalf of one person in one business day will be consolidated and reported as if the total exceeds $10,000. A copy of the electronically filed FinCEN CTR will be retained for five years (See Policy 10010, Table 10).\
      &#x20;
      1. CTRs are **not** required to be filed for transactions involving U.S. depository institutions; or federal, state or local government (or any entity exercising governmental authority). As part of the Credit Union’s Customer/Member Identification Program (CIP/MIP), the Credit Union will ensure the member’s initial eligibility for this exemption, and will document the basis for its conclusions.\
         &#x20;
      2. **Exemptions – Phase I**. A CTR is not required for transactions involving most corporations or other publicly traded entities (such as partnerships), which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or NASDAQ. In order to obtain the exemption, the Credit Union will file a Designation of Exempt Person (DEP) form with the U.S. Department of Treasury within 30 days after the first transaction in currency that the Credit Union wishes to exempt. \
         &#x20;
         1. The Credit Union will closely scrutinize members requesting exempt status to ensure that information received from the member is current and reliable, as failure to investigate the member exposes the Credit Union to liability for contributing to the success of a criminal enterprise. \
            &#x20;
         2. At least once per year, the Credit Union will review the eligibility of an exempt member to determine whether such member remains eligible for an exemption. Management will maintain a current list of all members whose transactions are exempt. The list shall include the following information: (a) Member’s name, (b) Address, (c) Type of business, and (d) Account number. Tellers must check the exempt list each time a member deposits or withdraws more than $10,000 (currency and coin). **If members are not exempt, tellers must complete a CTR**.\
            &#x20;
      3. **Exemptions – Phase II**. For members who qualify as either “non-listed businesses” or “payroll customers,” the Credit Union will file the FinCEN Designation of Exempt Person (DEP) form within 30 days after the first transaction in currency the Credit Union wishes to exempt. To qualify, the member must: (1) maintain an account with the Credit Union for at least two months (or is granted an exception based on a risk-based analysis of the legitimacy of the member’s transactions that has been conducted); (2) “frequently engage” in transactions in currency in excess of $10,000 (which means having actually conducted five (5) or more reportable cash transactions in each full year following the member’s initial designation); _**and**_ (3) be incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or any state. \
         &#x20;
         1. At least once per year, the Credit Union will review the eligibility of an exempt member to determine whether such member remains eligible for an exemption. The Credit Union will maintain a system of monitoring the transactions in currency of each exempt customer for any reportable suspicious activity. \
            &#x20;
         2. Certain businesses are _ineligible_ for treatment as an exempt non-listed business. Members who engage in multiple business activities may qualify so long as no more than 50% of its annual gross revenues are derived from one or more ineligible business activities. In these cases, the Credit Union will make a reasonable determination based on its understanding of the nature of the members’ business; the purpose of the member’s accounts; the actual or anticipated activity in those accounts; or by obtaining additional supporting materials (i.e., tax returns and/or unaudited financial statements). Ineligible activities include the following:\
            &#x20;
            1. Serving as a financial institution or as agents for a financial institution of any type;\
               &#x20;
            2. Purchasing or selling motor vehicles of any kind, vessels, aircraft, farm equipment or mobile homes;\
               &#x20;
            3. Practicing law, accounting or medicine;\
               &#x20;
            4. Auctioning or pawning of goods;\
               &#x20;
            5. Chartering or operation of ships, buses or aircraft;\
               &#x20;
            6. Engaging in gaming (other than licensed pari-mutuel betting at race tracks);\
               &#x20;
            7. Engaging in investment advisory services or investment banking services;\
               &#x20;
            8. Engaging in real estate brokerage, title insurance activities or real estate closings;\
               &#x20;
            9. Engaging in trade union activities; or\
               &#x20;
            10. Engaging in any other activity that may, from time to time, be specified by FinCEN. \
                &#x20;
      4. At the time a member’s ineligibility is discovered, the Credit Union will document its determination of ineligibility and will cease to treat the member as exempt.\
         &#x20;
   2. **SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT (SAR).** The Credit Union will complete and electronically file a SAR whenever the Credit Union knows or has reason to suspect that any crime or suspicious transaction related to money laundering or a violation of the BSA has occurred. A copy of the electronically filed form, along with any supporting documentation, will be retained for five years.\
      &#x20;\
      The Credit Union will report any crime or suspected crime and any suspected computer intrusion electronically using the FinCEN Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), within thirty (30) days after discovery. If no suspect can be identified, the Credit Union may use an additional thirty (30) days to file the report. For suspicious activity that continues, the Credit Union should be filing a SAR at least every 90 days to report that information to law enforcement.\
      &#x20;\
      For questions regarding suspicious activity that require immediate attention, call the BSA Regulatory Helpline at 800.949.2732, or to report suspicious transactions that may relate to terrorist activity the Credit Union should call the Financial Institutions Toll-Free Hotline at 866.556.3974 (7 days a week, 24 hours a day) and immediately notify an appropriate law enforcement authority in addition to filing timely a SAR. The Credit Union will maintain a copy of each SAR that it files and the original of all attachments to the SAR for five years (See Policy 10010, Table 10). To comply with Section 351 of the PATRIOT Act, except where such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or supervisory agency, the Credit Union will not provide any information that would disclose that it prepared or filed a SAR, and will cite 31 CFR 1020.320(e) and 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(a) for their refusal. The Credit Union should also notify FinCEN and the NCUA of any request. The Credit Union and any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Credit Union who files a voluntary or required SAR will be protected from liability for any disclosure contained in, or for failure to disclose the fact of such report.\
      &#x20;
      1. **Sharing SARs and SAR Information**. SARs are confidential. Therefore, the Credit Union will only disclose the SAR filing to fulfill responsibilities consistent with the BSA, such as to the appropriate law enforcement agency, regulator, and the Board, or its designated committee as outlined in this policy. The Credit Union will not provide information or notification that a transaction has been reported to a person (even if listed above) if that person is involved in the suspicious transaction warranting the SAR.\
         &#x20;
         1. The Credit Union may also share a SAR or SAR information with its affiliates (defined in the Credit Union’s Privacy policy (See **Policy 1615**), provided the affiliate is subject to SAR regulation. The Credit Union will ensure that its affiliates keep this information confidential. The Credit Union will **not** share SAR information with an affiliate when the Credit Union has reason to believe that the information may be disclosed to any person involved in the suspicious activity that is the subject of the SAR. \
            &#x20;
         2. Officials, employees, and agents, whether subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR, or the information contained within it, must decline to produce the SAR or to provide any information that would disclose that a SAR was prepared or filed, and notify FinCEN and the NCUA of the request. \
            &#x20;
      2. **Reportable Transactions**. \
         &#x20;
         1. **Unusual or suspicious transactions**, such as deposits; withdrawals; transfers between accounts; exchange of currency; loans; extensions of credit; purchases or sales of any stock, bond, share certificate, or other monetary instrument or investment security; any other payments, transfers, or deliveries by, through or to a financial institution; or purchases of depository checks by non-members. The Credit Union will verify the identity of non-members purchasing such items using government-issued identity cards with pictures.\
            &#x20;
         2. **Insider abuse involving any amount**. A SAR will be filed whenever the Credit Union knows, or has reason to suspect, that an official, employee or agent has committed, or aided in the commission of, a criminal violation, regardless of the amount involved.\
            &#x20;
         3. **Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be identified**. If it is determined before filing the SAR that the identified suspect or group of suspects used an alias, the information regarding the true identity, as well as the alias identifiers (such as driver licenses or social security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers), will be reported.\
            &#x20;
         4. \*\*Transactions aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of potential suspects. \*\*\
            &#x20;
         5. **Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or BSA violations**. These will be reported when the Credit Union knows or has reason to suspect that the transaction (1) involves funds derived from illegal activities; (2) is designed to evade the BSA; or (3) has no business or apparent lawful purpose. \
            &#x20;
      3. **Exceptions to Reporting Requirement**. The Credit Union need not file a SAR for a robbery or burglary committed or attempted that is reported to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, or for lost, missing, counterfeit, or stolen securities that are reported pursuant to 17 C.F.R.240.17(f)(1).\
         &#x20;
      4. **SAR Decision-Making.** The Credit Union will document SAR decisions, including the specific reason for filing or not filing a SAR. This provides a record of the decision-making process, including the final decision for contemplating, but not filing a SAR.\
         &#x20;
      5. **Report to Board or Designated Committee**. Management will notify the Board, or its designated committee, of the Credit Union’s SAR activity at least monthly. The Board will be notified of SAR activity immediately if the activity warrants immediate reporting. If the suspect is a director or member of a committee designated by the Board, the Credit Union will only notify the remaining directors, or designated committee members, who are not suspects, or will merely report the number of SARs filed, without providing specific information. The report will provide sufficient information on SAR filings to allow for the Board or designated committee to fulfill their fiduciary duties, while being mindful of the confidential nature of the SAR.\
         &#x20;
   3. **INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORTATION OF CURRENCY AND/OR MONETARY INSTRUMENT REPORT**. The Credit Union will file a Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instrument Report (CMIR) if it sends or receives more than $10,000 in currency or instruments into or out of the United States on its own behalf. The BSA does not require the Credit Union to file a CMIR in respect to currency or other instruments mailed or shipped through the postal service or by common carrier (armored car services), or the transfer of funds through normal banking procedures, which does not involve the physical transportation of currency or monetary instruments. The Credit Union will file the CMIR in 15 days after receipt (Recipients) of the currency or monetary instruments, with the Customs officer in charge at any port of entry or departure or by mail. The Credit Union will file the CMIR if the currency or other monetary instrument does not accompany the person (Shippers or Mailers) entering or departing the United States on or before the date of entry, departure, mailing, or shipping. Reports will be filed through FinCEN’s website.\
      &#x20;
   4. **FOREIGN FINANCIAL REPORT**. The Credit Union will file a report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts Report (FBAR) Form through the BSA e-filing System on or before April 15 of each year for all Credit Union financial account relationships outside the United States where the aggregate value exceeded $10,000 during the previous calendar year.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) may send a National Security Letter (NSL), which will require the Credit Union to share any requested information in the possession of the Credit Union with the FBI.\
   &#x20;
   1. **Required Sharing With FinCEN – Section 314(a).** The Credit Union designates its BSA Compliance Officer as the FinCEN contact person. Upon FinCEN’s request, the Credit Union will search its records for a specified individual or entity.\
      &#x20;
      1. **Certification**. Prior to FinCEN requesting information, the underlying federal law enforcement agency must provide FinCEN with a written certification, that the person named in the request is reasonably suspected, based on credible evidence, of engaging in money laundering or terrorist activity.\
         &#x20;
      2. **Record Search**. Upon receiving a FinCEN request, the Credit Union will search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained an account for, or has engaged in a transaction with, each named individual or entity. Unless otherwise specified in FinCEN’s request, the search will cover:\

            &#x20;
      3. **Report to FinCEN**. If the Credit Union finds an account or transaction identified with any individual, entity, or organization named in a FinCEN request, the Credit Union must report the match to FinCEN by completing the Subject Information Form. The Form only requires the Credit Union to place an “X” next to the particular named subject for which a match was found. The Credit Union will also provide point-of-contact information. The Credit Union will report this information to FinCEN within 14 days of the request via the Secure Information Sharing System (SISS).\
         &#x20;
      4. **Use and Confidentiality of Information**. The Credit Union will **not** use FinCEN information as the sole determination factor in filing a SAR or to determine whether to establish or maintain an account or to engage in a transaction. The Credit Union will **not** disclose to any person, other than FinCEN or the federal law enforcement agency on whose behalf FinCEN is requesting information, the fact that FinCEN has requested information, except to the extent necessary to comply with the request. The Credit Union may share this information under its “Voluntary Information Sharing” policy set forth below. The Credit Union will maintain adequate procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of FinCEN information requests.\
         &#x20;
      5. **Right to Financial Privacy Act**. Credit Union responses to FinCEN requests under this Information Sharing policy fall within permissible disclosure exceptions to the Right of Financial Privacy Act.\
         &#x20;
      6. \*\*Documentation. \*\*The Credit Union will store either the search verification document from the web-based 314(a) SISS or the Subject Response List for each transmission.\
         &#x20;
   2. **Voluntary Information Sharing – Section 314(b).** The Credit Union may share information with other financial institutions or associations of financial institutions regarding individuals, entities, and countries for purposes of detecting, identifying, or reporting activities that it suspects may involve money laundering or terrorist activities. If the Credit Union engages in this type of information sharing, it will not be liable to any person under any state or federal law or regulation or under any contract or other legally enforceable agreement, for such sharing, or for any failure to provide notice of such sharing, to an individual, entity, or organization that is identified in such sharing.\
      &#x20;
      1. **Certification**. If the Credit Union intends to share this information, it will submit a completed FinCEN Notice by accessing [FinCEN’s website](http://www.fincen.gov) and entering the appropriate information. Each certification is effective for one year beginning on the certification date. The Credit Union will submit a new certification annually.\
         &#x20;
      2. **Security and Confidentiality**. The Credit Union will create and maintain procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of shared information. This information will be used only to detect, identify, and report on activities that may involve terrorist or money laundering activities or to determine whether to establish or maintain an account, or to engage in a transaction. If the Credit Union suspects terrorist activity or money laundering, it will call FinCEN and, if appropriate, file a SAR. \
         &#x20;
   3. **Required Information Sharing with the FBI**. National Security Letters (NSLs) are investigative demands that may be issued by the local FBI office and other federal government authorities to obtain financial records from the Credit Union.\
      &#x20;
      1. **Security and Confidentiality**. NSLs are HIGHLY confidential, in that not even an examiner will review them. The Credit Union will create and maintain procedures to protect the confidentiality of the existence of any NSLs received. NSLs are NOT to be referenced in any SAR filings.\
         &#x20;
      2. **Questions**. Any and all questions related to an NSL are to be directed to the local FBI field office ONLY.\
         &#x20;
7. **PRODUCTION OF RECORDS**. In accordance with the PATRIOT Act, within 120 hours after receiving an NCUA information request related to its anti-money laundering compliance or a member or account signer, the Credit Union will provide or make available to NCUA, information and account documentation for any account opened, maintained, administered, or managed in the United States by the Credit Union.\
   &#x20;
8. **SPECIAL CONCERN TRANSACTIONS**. The PATRIOT Act authorizes the U.S. Treasury Department to issue regulations finding certain countries, areas, or persons to be of “special concern,” and the Credit Union will comply with any special record keeping and reporting requirements as applicable.\
   &#x20;
9. **CUSTOMER/MEMBER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM (CIP/MIP).** The Credit Union will undertake reasonable risk-based measures, appropriate for its size and type of business, to (i) verify the identity of any person seeking to open an account, to the extent reasonable and practicable; (ii) maintain a record of the information used to verify the person’s identity, and (iii) determine whether the person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the Credit Union by any government agency.\
   &#x20;
   1. **Definitions.** \
      &#x20;
      1. Under the CIP/MIP, an “account” means a formal arrangement established to provide ongoing services or other financial transactions. It applies to traditional accounts such as a checking, share draft, share, certificate account, asset account, and any loan or other extension of credit. An “account” does **not** include a product or service where the Credit Union does not establish a formal relationship with the person, such as: check cashing, wire transfer, sale of a check or money order, an account acquired through acquisition, merger, purchase of assets or assumption of liabilities, or an account opened for an employee benefit plan established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. \
         &#x20;
      2. A “customer” (“member” or “person”) includes individuals, and individuals who open a new account for corporations, partnerships, trusts, associations, etc. The CIP/MIP requires identification verification for customers opening an account and for any individual(s) authorized to open an account for a corporation, partnership, trust, association, guardianship, etc. Both deposit and lending functions are considered account relationships.\
         &#x20;
   2. **Identity Verification**. The Credit Union will create procedures to verify the identity of each member and person who opens an account, to the extent reasonable and practicable, to enable the Credit Union to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of the member or person. If a member or person refuses or is unable to provide the requested information within of account opening, the account will be closed. Credit Union employees may refuse to open the account until identification to be verified is provided. If a provisional account is opened, the individual will have no access to it until identification is verified. \
      &#x20;
      1. **Required Information**. The Credit Union will create procedures that specify the identifying information that the Credit Union will obtain from each member, beneficial owners of legal entity members or person opening an account. At a minimum, the Credit Union will obtain the following information from an individual or entity prior to opening an account:\
         &#x20;
         1. Name (individual name) or (entity name & any assumed business name);\
            &#x20;
         2. Date of birth (if individual);\
            &#x20;

            2. Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) box number or residential or business street address of next of kin or of another contact individual (if individual); or\
               &#x20;
            3. Principal place of business, local office, or other physical location (if person is other than an individual, i.e., corporation, partnership, trust, estate, guardianship).\
               &#x20;
            4. In states that have established an Address Confidentiality Program (ACP), if the individual participates, the street address of the ACP sponsoring agency.\
               &#x20;
         4. Identification Number:\
            &#x20;
            1. For a U.S. person, a TIN, SSN, ITIN, EIN.\
               &#x20;
            2. For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following:\
               &#x20;

               4. Number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing photograph or similar safeguard. If opening an account for a foreign business without an identification number, the Credit Union will request alternative government issued documentation certifying the existence of the business/enterprise.\
                  &#x20;
      2. **Limited Exceptions**.\
         &#x20;
         1. **TIN Applied For**. The Credit Union may open an account for a non-person (i.e., corporation, partnership, or trust) that has applied for, but has not received, a TIN if the Credit Union maintains procedures to confirm that the TIN application was filed before the customer opens the account and obtains the TIN within a reasonable period of time after it opens the account. If the Credit Union does **not** receive the TIN within weeks, the account will be closed.\
            &#x20;
         2. **Credit Card Account**. In connection with a person who opens a credit card account, the Credit Union may obtain the identifying information about a person by acquiring it from a third-party source (i.e., credit reporting agency) prior to extending credit to the person.\
            &#x20;
      3. **Verification**. The Credit Union will follow risk-based procedures for verifying the identity of the member, using the information obtained within a reasonable time after an account is opened. The procedures will describe when the Credit Union will use documents, non-documentary methods, or a combination of both methods.\
         &#x20;
         1. **Verification Through Documents**. For accounts opened in person, the Credit Union will verify the identity of each person or entity through the following documents:\
            &#x20;
            1. **For Individuals**: unexpired government-issued identification evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard (such as a driver’s license or passport).\
               &#x20;
            2. **For Non-Individuals**: documents showing the existence of the entity (registered articles of incorporation or organization, government issued business license; or Partnership Agreement or trust instrument.) All non-individual accounts must have the identity of all beneficial owners of the entity identified and valid SSNs must be provided to the Credit Union prior to account opening.\
               &#x20;
         2. **Lending Transactions**. To prevent fraud, the Credit Union will create procedures to verify member information against the applications it receives, and ensure proper authentication of the identity of each individual filing an online loan application.\
            &#x20;
         3. **Documentatio**n. The Credit Union will create procedures for making and maintaining a record of all verification information obtained. At a minimum, the record must include:\
            &#x20;
            1. All identifying information about a member (person) obtained;\
               &#x20;
            2. A description of any document that was relied on, noting the type of document, any identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance and, if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;\
               &#x20;
            3. A description of the methods and the results of any measures undertaken to verify the identity of the member (person); and\
               &#x20;
            4. A description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.\
               &#x20;
      4. **Non-Documentary Verification Methods**. The Credit Union will use non-documentary methods to verify a member’s or person’s identity in addition to, or instead of, identification documents, and will create procedures to specify when non-documentary verification methods will be used and the types of non-documentary methods to be used. These methods may include: contacting a member or person; independently verifying the member’s or person’s identity through the comparison of information provided by the member or person with information obtained from a consumer reporting agency, public database, or other source; checking references with other financial institutions; and obtaining a financial statement.\
         &#x20;
      5. **Account Closure**. When a provisional account is opened without obtaining documents, all attempts will be made to retrieve the required documentation to confirm the person's identity. If this information is not obtained within , the account will be closed and funds will be returned to the current account owner(s). Any exceptions to this procedure must be approved by , based on the non-documentary verification obtained.\
         &#x20;
      6. **Verify Identifying Information on Existing Members**. The Credit Union will not verify information about an existing member seeking to open a new account, if it: (a) previously verified the member’s or person’s identity in accordance with its policies and procedures; (b) continues to have a reasonable belief that it knows the member’s or person’s true identity; (c) the Credit Union has a reasonable belief that the member, previously identified, is the person who is opening the account; and (d) the verification process is documented on the signature card or comment log within the account or loan file.\
         &#x20;
      7. Identifying Information on Legal Entity Members. The Credit Union will identify the beneficial owners of each legal entity at the time a new account is opened, even if they are an existing member, by obtaining a certification, similar to the Customer Due Diligence Certification Form, Appendix A or another method, provided the individual completing the form certifies (to the best of their knowledge) that the information is accurate. The Credit Union will also update beneficial ownership information on their members on an event-driven basis, when in normal course monitoring they detect information that may be relevant, such as a potential change in the ownership structure or unexplained change in activity.\
         &#x20;
   3. **Lack of Verification**. The Credit Union will create procedures to determine its actions if it cannot verify a new member’s or person’s identity through documentary or non-documentary means. Depending upon the type of account requested, the Credit Union may permit limited transactions, while identity is being verified. After days, if the Credit Union cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a member or person, the account will **not** be opened or if it was opened, it will be closed. Risk will determine final policy decisions when there is a lack of identification verification.\
      &#x20;
   4. **Record Retention**. The Credit Union will retain all identifying information about a member (person) or legal entity beneficial owner(s) obtained for five years after the date the account is closed or, in the case of credit card accounts, five years after the account is closed or becomes dormant (See Policy 10010, Table 10). The Credit Union will retain for five years after the record is made: \
      &#x20;
      1. A description of any document that was relied on, noting the type of document, any identification number contained in the document, the place of issuance and, if any, the date of issuance and expiration date;\
         &#x20;
      2. A description of the methods and the results of any measures undertaken to verify the identity of the member (person); and\
         &#x20;
      3. A description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying the identifying information obtained.\
         &#x20;
   5. **Comparison with Government Lists**. The Credit Union will check member and authorized signer names against any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided by any government agency and designated as such by the U.S. Treasury Department in consultation with Federal regulators. This determination will be made at account opening. If a person’s name is on a list, the Credit Union will look to its OFAC procedures for the appropriate action. If there is a match, all further account action will be stopped and the Compliance Officer will be notified. Further investigating will be done before the account opening process resumes. If the Credit Union confirms a legitimate hit on any government list, the Credit Union will immediately notify the proper regulatory agency. The Credit Union will maintain documentation to show that it follows this process.\
      &#x20;
   6. **Notice.** The Credit Union will provide persons with notice that the Credit Union is requesting information to verify their identities, in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that a member or person is able to view the notice before opening an account. For example, the Credit Union may post a notice in the lobby or on its website, include the notice on its account applications, or use any other form of written or oral notice. The Credit Union will use a notice substantially similar to the following:\
      &#x20;
      1. **IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT**. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We also may ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.\
         &#x20;
   7. **Reliance on Another Financial Institution**. The Credit Union may create procedures which specify when the Credit Union will rely on the performance by another financial institution (including an affiliate) or any procedures of the Credit Union’s CIP/MIP, with respect to any member of the Credit Union that is opening an account or has established a similar formal relationship with the other financial institution to provide or engage in services, dealings, or other financial transactions, provided that:\
      &#x20;
      1. Such reliance is reasonable under the circumstances;\
         &#x20;
      2. The other financial institution is subject to a rule implementing 31 U.S.C. § 5318(h) and is regulated by a Federal functional regulator; and\
         &#x20;
      3. The other financial institution enters into a contract requiring it to certify annually to the Credit Union that it has implemented its anti-money laundering program, and that it will perform (or its agent will perform) the specified requirements of the Credit Union’s CIP/MIP.\
         &#x20;
10. **MARIJUANA-RELATED BUSINESSES**. If the Credit Union services marijuana-related businesses, it will comply with the Credit Union's Marijuana-Related Business Accounts Policy (See Policy 2112\*\*)\*\*. If the Credit Union does not service marijuana-related businesses, it will comply with the Credit Union's Not Servicing Marijuana-Related Businesses Policy (See Policy 2113).
11. \*\*PREPAID AND GIFT CARDS. \*\*To limit risk and ensure due diligence of the purchaser, the Credit Union only offers prepaid and/or gift cards to members of the Credit Union. The Credit Union will also implement the following to mitigate BSA/AML risk.
    1. **Third-party Service Providers.** When using a third-party service provider to offer, manage, distribute, process or otherwise implement a prepaid access program, the Credit Union will ensure third-party service provider has appropriate BSA/AML compliance programs, including system integrity and monitoring capabilities. The Credit Union will also document the roles and responsibilities of third-parties, ensure member confidentiality provisions are maintained in contracts, and ensure the Credit Union has access to information necessary to monitor transactional activity and audit the third-party provider in compliance with contractual obligations. The Credit Union will comply with the requirements outlined in Policy 2185 (Third Party Due Diligence & Oversight).
    2. **Product Features and Distribution.** The Credit Union may also limit risk by implementing product features such as:
       1. Limits or prohibitions on cash loans, access, or redemption.
       2. Limits or prohibitions on amounts of loads and number of loads/reloads within a specific timeframe.
       3. Controls on the number of cards purchased by one member.
       4. Maximum dollar thresholds on ATM withdrawals and on the number of withdrawals within a specific timeframe.
       5. Maximum dollar thresholds on Point of Sale (POS) transactions (daily or monthly).
       6. Limits on aggregate card values.
       7. Limits or prohibitions on certain usage, such as geographic or by merchant type.
    3. **Reporting.** As with other member account activity, the Credit Union will ensure transactions are monitored and suspicious activity reported in accordance with this policy.
