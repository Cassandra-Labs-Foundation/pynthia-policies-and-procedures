## Compliance Program Overview

The Credit Union's Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program is designed to comply with various U.S. laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act, the BSA, and related regulations to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.

### Definitions

1. **Money Laundering**: Money laundering is the criminal practice of processing “dirty” money through a series of transactions to “clean” the funds so that they appear to be proceeds from legal activities. It may not involve currency (cash) at every stage of the laundering process and generally involves three independent steps (that can occur at the same time):
   1. **Placement**: Structuring currency deposits in amounts to evade reporting requirements or commingling currency deposits of legal and illegal activities.
      * Large number of deposits below the reporting threshold.
      * Depositing a refund check from a canceled vacation package or insurance policy.
      * Buying a series of monetary instruments that are collected and deposited at another location.
   2. **Layering**: Moving funds around the financial system, often in a complex series of transactions.
      * Exchanging monetary instruments for larger or smaller amounts.
      * Wiring or transferring funds to and through numerous accounts in one or more financial institutions.
   3. **Integration**: Creating the appearance of legality through additional transactions.
      * The purchase and resale of real estate or other assets.
2. **Terrorist Financing**: Activities financing a terrorist organization are often funded through legitimate sources, such as:
   * Charitable donations
   * Business ownership
   * Personal employment
