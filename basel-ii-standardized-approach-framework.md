### 1. Introduction

This policy ensures \[Credit Union Name] maintains robust capital and liquidity positions to support member services, absorb losses, and comply with regulatory expectations. As a US Credit Union regulated by the NCUA, we are not directly subject to Basel II (an international banking standard from 2004). However, adopting its principles enhances risk management and prepares for potential harmonization with banking standards.

Basel II focuses on:

* **Pillar 1**: Minimum capital requirements for credit, market, and operational risks (Basel II, Section II, paras. 6-659).
* **Pillar 2**: Supervisory review process for internal capital adequacy assessments (Basel II, Section III, paras. 660-709).
* **Pillar 3**: Market discipline through disclosures (Basel II, Section IV, paras. 800-881).

Key adaptations for credit unions:

* Capital calculations use NCUA's risk-based net worth ratio (RBC ratio = Adjusted Net Worth / Risk-Weighted Assets ≥ 8% for well-capitalized status; 12 CFR § 702.104).
* Liquidity aligns with NCUA's liquidity risk management guidance (Letter to Credit Unions 13-CU-10) and access to the Central Liquidity Facility (CLF; 12 CFR Part 725).
* This framework is for internal use and future-proofing; actual compliance follows NCUA rules.

### 2. Scope and Applicability

* **Applies To**: All assets, liabilities, and off-balance-sheet exposures of \[Credit Union Name].
* **Exclusions**: Secondary capital for low-income designated credit unions (per NCUA rules).
* **Assumptions**: Uses the standardized approach for risk weighting (Basel II, CRE20; NCUA equivalent in 12 CFR § 702.104). Advanced approaches (e.g., IRB for credit risk) may be considered if NCUA approves.
* **Governance**: The Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) oversees implementation; the Board reviews annually. Management conducts quarterly assessments.

### 3. Capital Adequacy

Capital adequacy ensures sufficient buffers against risks. We target ratios exceeding NCUA minima, informed by Basel II's 8% total capital requirement (Basel II, para. 26).

#### 3.1 Minimum Capital Requirements

* **Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio**: ≥ 8% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) (Basel II, para. 26; NCUA: RBC ratio ≥ 8% for well-capitalized).
* **Tier 1 Capital Ratio**: ≥ 6% of RWA (Basel II, para. 29; enhanced from 4% for conservatism; NCUA aligns via adjusted net worth).
  * Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1): ≥ 4.5% of RWA (Basel II base, aligned with NCUA retained earnings focus).
* **Leverage Ratio**: ≥ 4% (Tier 1 capital / total assets; Basel II, para. 51; NCUA: Net worth ≥ 4% of assets for adequately capitalized).
* **Calculation**: Quarterly, using NCUA's RBC calculator. Includes retained earnings, undivided earnings, and qualifying secondary capital (NCUA § 702.2).

If ratios fall below targets, trigger contingency plans (e.g., dividend restrictions, asset sales).

#### 3.2 Components of Capital

Per Basel II (paras. 48-58) and NCUA (§ 702.2):

* **Tier 1 Capital** (core, highest quality):
  * Common stock equivalents (for credit unions: retained earnings).
  * Non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (if applicable).
  * Deductions: Goodwill, deferred tax assets >10% of Tier 1.
* **Tier 2 Capital** (supplementary):
  * Subordinated debt, general loan loss reserves (up to 1.25% of RWA; NCUA cap).
  * Revaluation reserves.
* Total Capital = Tier 1 + Tier 2.
* Exclusions: Intangible assets, unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities (unless NCUA-permitted).

#### 3.3 Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)

RWA = Sum of (Exposure Amount × Risk Weight). Uses standardized approach (Basel II, Section II.A; NCUA § 702.104). See [#id-6.-risk-weights](basel-ii-standardized-approach-framework.md#id-6.-risk-weights "mention") for risk weights.

* **Credit Risk RWA**: Primary focus (Basel II, paras. 139-366).
* **Operational Risk RWA**: 15% of average annual gross income over 3 years (Basic Indicator Approach; Basel II, paras. 635-647; NCUA embeds in overall RBC).
* **Market Risk RWA**: For trading assets >10% of total assets, use standardized method (specific risk + general market risk; Basel II, paras. 707-720). Credit unions typically have minimal trading; if applicable, capital charge = 8% × Market RWA.

Pillar 2 requires internal capital adequacy assessment (ICAAP) annually, stress testing scenarios (e.g., 20% member share outflow; NCUA guidance).

### 4. Liquidity Requirements

Basel II lacks specific liquidity standards (introduced in Basel III, paras. 100-102). This policy incorporates NCUA liquidity rules for completeness (12 CFR § 741.12; Letter 13-CU-10).

* **Liquidity Policy Requirement**: Maintain a board-approved written policy covering sources (cash, CLF advances) and uses (loan funding, withdrawals).
* **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) Target**: ≥ 100% (high-quality liquid assets / 30-day stressed outflows; Basel III-inspired, voluntary for credit unions >$250M assets).
  * High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA): Cash, US Treasuries (0% risk weight).
  * Stressed Outflows: 10% of shares (stable), 25% (less stable; NCUA guidance).
* **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) Target**: ≥ 100% (available stable funding / required stable funding; Basel III-inspired).
* **Monitoring**: Weekly liquidity position reports. Minimum: 1-month coverage of outflows at 100% of net cash inflows.
* **Contingency Funding Plan (CFP)**: Addresses moderate/severe stress (e.g., cyber event, recession). Includes CLF access (up to 25% of shares; 12 CFR Part 725).
* **Limits**: Loan-to-share ratio ≤ 85% (NCUA benchmark); diversify funding sources (<50% from single source).

Triggers: If liquidity < 20% of shares, activate CFP.

### 5. Buffer Ratios

Basel II has no explicit buffers (added in Basel III, para. 37). For future-proofing, adopt:

* **Capital Conservation Buffer**: 2.5% of RWA (CET1; Basel III, para. 37). Combined with minimum: Total CET1 ≥ 7%.
* **Countercyclical Buffer**: 0-2.5% (activated if credit growth >10%; NCUA may align).
* **Systemic Buffer**: Not applicable to credit unions.
* **Implementation**: Phased in if NCUA adopts. Breaches restrict dividends/payouts (e.g., 60% restriction if buffer <1.25%).

Stress tests (annual for >$10B assets; NCUA § 702.304) ensure buffers hold under adverse scenarios (e.g., 10% GDP drop).

### 6. Risk Weights

Risk weights adjust exposures for riskiness. Standardized approach per Basel II (Table 1, paras. 52-53; CRE20) and NCUA (§ 702.104). Credit unions use NCUA-specific weights where differing.

* **NCUA Specifics**: Investments in CUSOs (100-300%); derivatives (market risk equivalent).

### 7. Monitoring, Reporting, and Compliance

* **Pillar 2 Review**: Annual ICAAP documents risks beyond Pillar 1 (e.g., concentration, interest rate risk).
* **Pillar 3 Disclosures**: Annual report includes capital ratios, RWA breakdown, risk exposures (Basel II, paras. 805-819). Post on website.
* **Reporting**: To NCUA via Call Report (NCUA 5300); internal board reports.
* **Non-Compliance**: If ratios < targets, notify Board within 10 days; implement recovery plan (e.g., reduce dividends, per NCUA PCA matrix, § 702.204).
* **Training**: Annual for staff on risk weighting and liquidity stress.
