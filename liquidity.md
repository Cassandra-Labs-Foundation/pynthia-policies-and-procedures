## CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN

## PURPOSE

The purpose of the contingency funding plan is to establish procedures which will ensure the liquidity of the Bank is properly managed in a stressful or crisis situation.

## ROLE OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT

It is the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in combination with the members of the Bank’s ALCO Committee, to continually monitor and analyze the Bank’s loan portfolio, deposit structure and investment portfolio to maintain adequate liquidity under all circumstances.

\


## MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES

Management intends to maintain high quality and dependable sources of funding through the normal course of business.  As a bank, funding operations are highly dependent on customer activity.  Therefore, management will use an array of alternative funding sources to augment and stabilize the funding of the bank.  As such, the overall funds risk management strategy is multi-faceted, and includes the following objectives: &#x20;

\


* The ability to identify a potential liquidity short-fall – The Bank monitors its Net Loans to Deposits ratio on a daily basis to ensure compliance with ALCO limits.  Cash letters and available lines of credit are also monitored on a daily basis. Material short term changes in investment and deposit portfolios are also monitored and taken into consideration. The Bank uses a loan pipeline report to monitor short-term expected loan growth. For longer term planning, the Bank utilizes a Sources and Uses of funds out 90 days with two shock scenarios (worst case and likely case) to identify and address liquidity short-falls.&#x20;
* The ability to respond appropriately to liquidity short-fall - The CFO and CEO, along with other members of the ALCO Committee, will determine the appropriate response to an identified liquidity short-fall. In the event that external communications are required, the Bank’s Board of Directors will also be involved.

\


In a stressed scenario, such as a liquidity crisis, should the need arise to contact external parties, the responsibilities would be as follows:

\


CEO:  Regulators, Press and Significant Customers

CFO:  Investors, External Auditors, Vendors (if appropriate)

\


The internal communication in a stressed scenario would consist of the CEO contacting the Board and executive management, the CEO would then direct the CFO to compile necessary reports, i.e. Sources and Uses of Cash, Large Depositor Report, Daily Liquidity Reports, to allow the Board and management to understand the severity of the circumstances and to implement the appropriate responses.

\


* The ability to raise funds in an acceptable time frame – The Bank maintains collateralized credit lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) which can be used in the event of a liquidity short-fall. These lines are tested periodically in order to ensure availability and ease of access. The Bank also maintains a subscription to QwickRate which can be used to raise funds.
* The ability to raise funds at an acceptable cost – In a normal operating environment, it is the Bank’s objective to utilize the lowest cost sources of funding available in order to maximize net interest margin. In a stressed operating environment, higher cost funding sources may be utilized in order to meet liquidity time-lines.

## LIQUIDITY SOURCES

The day to day maintenance and use of the Bank’s primary liquidity sources will be under the supervision of the CFO. The source of funds utilized to fulfill liquidity requirements at any given time may vary based on a number of factors including: 1) the projected duration of time the funds will be needed; 2) the specific cause(s) of the liquidity need; 3) the current and projected interest rate outlook; 4) the current and projected economic conditions; and 5) the current and projected balance sheet composition. These and any other relevant factors will be evaluated by the CFO and CEO to determine the appropriate liquidity source.

\


The following are the Bank’s major internal and external liquidity sources:

#### Internal:

Federal Funds Sold – Overnight federal funds sold resulting from increased deposits or reductions in the loan or investment portfolios, will be utilized as needed to meet day to day liquidity requirements.

\


Investment Portfolio – The Bank maintains a portfolio of Available-for-Sale securities. As certain of these securities have been pledged as collateral for deposits or lines of credit and this source is not as liquid as others, the investment portfolio is a secondary source of liquidity.

\


Saleable Assets – It is the policy of the Bank to structure its commercial real estate loans to meet the requirements of the secondary market in the event that the Bank elects to sell these loans to provide additional liquidity.&#x20;

#### External:

FHLB Advances – The Bank maintains a collateralized line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle which can be utilized as needed to meet day to day liquidity requirements.  This line is tested periodically to ensure its availability.

Federal Reserve Discount Window – The Bank has established a collateralized line of credit through the Federal Reserve in San Francisco which can be utilized as needed to meet day to day liquidity requirements. This line is tested periodically to ensure its availability.

QwickRate – The Bank maintains a subscription to QwickRate which allows us to obtain additional deposits from institutional investors through the wholesale CD market. These deposits are considered non-brokered, core deposits. The determination to use this source is dependent on the rate, availability of deposits in our local market, availability of other liquidity sources, and the time frame involved.

\


## LIQUIDITY MONITORING&#x20;

\


The primary measurement of liquidity concern is the following:     &#x20;

\


Liquid Assets:  Cash + Balances Due from Banks + Securities + Fed Fund Sold /Total Assets

#### NORMAL ENVIRONMENT

#### Liquidity is considered “Normal” when liquid assets exceed 10% assets

* Maintain lines on contingency funding schedule
* Maintain collateral position for contingency purposes.
* Report availabilities to board or delegated committee in normal course of business

\
\


ALCO meetings are held at least quarterly. The minutes of the ALCO meetings are presented to the Board.

&#x20;At ALCO meetings, the following information is routinely presented and discussed.&#x20;

\


* Sources and Uses of funds out 90 days with two shock scenarios (worst case and likely case).&#x20;
* Capital Ratios as compared to Policy&#x20;
* Liquidity Ratios as compared to Policy
* ALX – Quarterly&#x20;
* Large Depositor Report
* Lines of Credit Report
* Articles and publications discussing economic conditions
* Loan to Deposit Ratio

\


The LOAN TO DEPOSIT ratio shall be equal to or less than 85%.  &#x20;

#### STRESSED ENVIRONMENT

#### Liquidity is considered “Watch” when liquid assets are below 10% assets or there is a 20% decrease in deposits (excluding brokered and financial institution deposits)

* Inventory liquidity facilities
* Conduct audit of liquidity facilities
* Ensure collateral is pledged to facilities
* Test or make contact with sources to ensure availability
* Update contingency funding schedule for any changes
* Notify senior management of any changes
* Inform operational staff of liquidity level

#### Liquidity is considered “Low” when liquid assets are below Watch or there is a 30% decrease in deposits (excluding brokered and financial institution deposits)&#x20;

* Hold senior level meetings to determine best strategy
* Estimate duration of low liquidity position
* Consider selling securities or marketable loans if situation looks permanent
* Consider permanent funding if situation looks permanent.
* Consider ALM and IRR impacts of funding decisions
* Inform operational staff of senior management decisions
* Inform board or delegated committee, if material

#### Liquidity is considered “Critical” when liquid assets are below Watch or there is a 40% or more decrease in deposits (excluding brokered and financial institution deposits)&#x20;

* Permanent funding and/or asset liquidation is required to return liquidity to normal levels.
* #### Remove the amount borrowed on facility from schedule of availability
* This level constitutes a “run” on the bank.&#x20;
* Report circumstances and action taken to Board of Directors.

\
\


ALCO meetings are held monthly. The minutes of the ALCO meetings are presented to the Board.

&#x20;

Any sudden or protracted withdrawal of deposits will be addressed by the CEO and CFO. Excluded from these withdrawals will be the normal, monthly quarterly and seasonal fluctuations in both public and non-public funds. The Executive Management team will attempt to determine the possible cause(s) for the outflow of funds, which may include:

\


1\. Management changes or departures

2\. Rumors concerning the safety and soundness of the Bank or banks in general

3\. Unfavorable press

4\. Asset quality problems

5\. Failure of or trouble at an in-market competitor

6\. Rumors or announcement of a merger

\


Once the potential cause(s) of the outflow has been identified, a determination of the potential severity of the stress situation and the likelihood of its persistence will be assessed by the ALCO committee. The severity of the situation will determine the appropriate course of action.

\


## CONTINGENT FUNDING MANAGEMENT RISKS

#### Becoming less than Well Capitalized

## Becoming less than well capitalized poses the single biggest risk to continued operations for “business as usual”. &#x20;

* Deposit insurance will increase substantially
* Bank earnings will decline significantly due to the increase expense
* FHLB status would likely deteriorate to “custody status” only
* Bank would not be able to use its blanket lien
* Bank will have to replace blanket lien with loans and securities
* Must seek FDIC waiver to accept or renew any brokered deposits
* Waiver is unlikely to be obtained
* Bank may not pay a rate of interest exceeding the FDIC-defined "national rate."&#x20;
* Funding could likely be hampered
* Fed funds lines of credit will likely be canceled or will require collateral
* Cash letter and lines accounts will need to be secured

\


#### Becoming Undercapitalized

## If the bank becomes undercapitalized then further restrictions become applicable as follows:

* The bank shall pay no management fee to any person having control
* The bank shall not permit its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets during the preceding calendar quarter unless
* The bank shall not, directly or indirectly, acquire any interest in any company or insured depository institution, establish or acquire any additional branch office, or engage in any new line of business&#x20;
* The bank may be required to sell enough shares or obligations of the institution so that the institution will be adequately capitalized after the sale.&#x20;
* The bank shall not accept deposits from correspondent depository institutions, including renewals and rollovers of prior deposits.&#x20;
* The bank may be required to take any other action that the regulatory agency determines will better carry out the purpose of this section than any of the actions described in this paragraph.&#x20;
* The bank shall not pay any bonus to any senior executive officer nor provide compensation at a rate exceeding that officer’s average rate of compensation.

#### Change in credit rating

The bank does not have a National Recognized Statistical Rating from a third party organization.  Generally, community banks are too small to have a firm consider them for a rating, plus the service tends to be cost prohibitive.  The bigger risk to community banks is the scoring models used by FITCH, IDC, Weis and others using call report data which arrive at  estimated “CAMELS” rating.  Due to the lack of a formal credit rating, the risk of customers monitoring such scoring models is low. This event would not be expected to cause any significant liquidity issue.

#### Deterioration in asset quality

## Deterioration in asset quality generally produces strains on earnings and capital.  Earnings are strained as assets are moved to non-accrual status and provisions for future or potential losses increase.  These actions cause both net interest income and provision expenses to increase.  Capital becomes strained because earnings are not enough to augment capital and/or absorb the increase risk.  Management shall consider shrinking the asset size of the bank during such times to ensure capital protection is commensurate with the risk of the bank. Deterioration in asset quality results in lower lending limits possibly causing existing customers to refinance elsewhere; when loans leave the bank, the relationship is also at risk. If this scenario causes a decrease in deposits, liquidity could be affected. If liquidity declines or deposits decrease 10% to 40% or more, the steps will be taken that are listed in the “stressed environment” section of this CFP. &#x20;

#### Unplanned asset growth

## The bank does not expect rapid asset growth, rather growth in a controlled fashion and in proportion to capital.  Rapid growth produces strains on management, personnel, systems and earnings.  Rapid growth also increases the risk profile of the bank, as many changes occur in all areas of the bank at once.

#### Loss of access to market funding sources

## The biggest risk to losing market funding sources is losing access to the FHLB system, brokered deposits and fed funds lines of credit.  These sources represent the extent of wholesale funding sources used by community banks.  The goal of the bank is to maintain these facilities so they are used in the normal course of business as well as for contingent funding sources.  If the bank loses access to such sources, the primary goal for re-establishing such facilities is to secure with readily marketable collateral, or loans in the case of the FHLB.  The bank may be required to liquidate loans in order to produce cash to purchase securities for these facilities.   This scenario stresses liquid assets, mostly the access to cash. Loss of access to funding sources requires the bank to keep liquidity available such as investment CD’s that can be redeemed as needed, short term securities held AVS, and accurate and complete loan files able to be pledged.

#### Operating losses

## Operating losses signal operational deficiencies and increasing risk to creditors, correspondent banks, and providers of wholesale funds.   The bank will try to minimize losses during poor economic times but fully recognize all known losses in order that counterparties, regulators, creditors and others may fully know the extent of the bank’s problems.  Furthermore, the transparency in financial statements is designed to provide faith in management’s ability to manage the crisis.  Management will also maintain capital at levels that mitigate occasional years of operational losses.  Losses can be caused by difficult economic conditions, defalcations, judgment, borrower issues and more.  Early recognition and full disclosure remain the best proactive measures.  Operating losses result in lower lending limits possibly causing existing customers to refinance elsewhere; when loans leave the bank, the relationship is also at risk. If this scenario causes a decrease in deposits, liquidity could be affected. If liquidity declines or deposits decrease 10% to 40% or more, the steps will be taken that are listed in the “stressed environment” section of this CFP. &#x20;

\


#### Negative Press

## Negative press mostly affects the public perception of the bank and therefore will affect retail funding of the bank.  Negative press can be warranted and unwarranted but nonetheless must be dealt with on equally important resolve.  Retail funding is sensitive to negative press and bad press would likely cause declines in deposit volumes from non-core customers.  Sustained negative press would eventually cause core customer deposits to leave.  Management will make every effort to contact its core customers during periods of negative press to keep them apprised of problems and corrective actions.  During these times, management will be responsible for coordinating customer efforts and responses.  Any contact with the media shall be made by the President and CEO or his delegate.  Negative press creates the risk of a “run on the bank”. If deposits decrease 40% or more the steps will be taken that are listed in the “Critical” liquidity section of this CFP. &#x20;

\
\


#### Other events

## The bank should stay aware of other possible risks that may or potentially could affect the liquidity of the bank. &#x20;

\


## EARLY WARNING INDICATORS

Senior management shall monitor for potential liquidity stress events by using early warning indicators, event triggers, and reportable levels.  By recognizing potential stress events early, senior management can proactively position itself into progressive states of readiness as an event evolves. This proactive stance also provides senior management with the opportunity for communicating among different levels and outside parties.&#x20;

\


Early warning indicators include the following:

\


* Rapid asset growth funded with potentially volatile liabilities;
* Growing or undue concentrations in assets or liabilities;
* Negative trends or heightened risk associated with a particular product line;
* Third-party ratings and downgrades;
* Negative publicity;
* Significant deterioration in earnings, asset quality, and overall financial condition;
* Difficulty accessing longer-term funding;
* Increasing collateral margin requirements;
* Rising funding costs in a stable market;
* Increasing redemptions of CDs before maturity;
* Correspondent banks eliminate or decrease lines.

\


PRECURSORY ACTION PLANS &#x20;

In light of impending liquidity problems, management may take proactive steps to obtain liquidity and funding for the bank.  Management will work to stave off any liquidity and funding problems by taking proactive steps.  Liquidity and funding changes in the normal course of business or low volume changes can be handled with relative ease.  Significant and sudden changes in liquidity and funding may cause strains on the bank if management is not prepared accordingly. &#x20;

\


The following is a list of precursory action plans:&#x20;

Precursory action plans - Management

* Maintain brokered deposit registrations&#x20;
* Maintain FHLB membership&#x20;
* Maintain FRB Primary Credit availability
* Make any necessary collateral pledges&#x20;
* Investigate access to capital if needed
* Notify correspondent banks and other interested parties

Precursory action plans – Assets

* Purchase securities for use in pledging
* Sell securities to roll into fed funds sold
* Allow securities maturities to roll into fed fund sold
* Identify loans that can be sold
* Identify loans that can be participated to upstream correspondent banks
* Identify loans from the remaining loans that can be pledged
* Suspend lending activities

Precursory action plans - Liabilities

* Lengthen term of certificates of deposits
* Lengthen term of FHLB borrowings
* Lengthen term of FRB Primary Credit borrowings
* Purchase brokered deposits for added liquidity

\
\


## STRESS TESTING

Bank managers must focus on adequate liquidity during both normal and stress times.  Prudent managers use scenario stress testing analysis to evaluate the effect of bank-specific and systemic event conditions on liquidity adequacy.  Bank-specific scenarios may include scenarios with deteriorating asset quality, decreased credit capacity, or operational deficiencies.  Systemic events affect the industry’s overall liquidity levels and may involve disruptions to the broader liquidity markets and payment system. &#x20;

\


## Key elements of a stress test would include the following:

\


* Valid base case scenario
* Robust bank-specific crisis
* Robust system stress crisis
* Clearly defined external market/economic context
* Clearly defined scenario articulation
* Sufficient severity in crisis
* Transparency and understanding of results
* Senior management involvement in the process
* Credible senior management actions
* Simple and clear presentation of results
* Easily understood liquidity funding metrics

\
\


Stress testing can be presented using different types of formats.  Some of the acceptable formats are:

\


* Cash flow projections
* Balance sheet impacts
* Combination of both

\


Stress testing shall be conducted as needed.
