**General Policy Statement:**  
This policy sets forth 's (Credit Union) responsibility to assess, protect against, respond to, and potentially recover from events that may impact the Credit Union or its members. Business Continuity Planning is an ongoing process, not a singular event. The Credit Union is committed to developing and sustaining its Business Continuity capabilities.

1. **BOARD OF DIRECTORS.** The Board of Directors bears the fiduciary responsibility to protect the assets of the Credit Union. This responsibility includes the need to understand Business Continuity risks and adopt policies and plans to address them. The Board will weigh the costs of Business Continuity Program activity versus the benefits and authorize the actions and resources necessary to provide prudent protection. The Board of Directors will (1) approve the credit union’s written Business Continuity Program Policy; and (2) oversee the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Business Continuity program, including assigning specific responsibility for its implementation. The Board will ensure program activities align with business strategies and risk appetite, and assess the effectiveness of these activities through Management reporting, auditing, and reviewing of relevant program documentation.  
      
2. **MANAGEMENT TEAM**. The management team of the Credit Union is empowered to develop and implement the Business Continuity Program under the direction of the Board. The management team will do the following:  
       
   1. Oversee the development and implementation of the Business Continuity program;  
         
   2. Draft procedures to ensure compliance with the program;   
         
   3. Monitor, evaluate and suggest adjustments to the program;   
         
   4. Ensure staff is trained on these issues;   
         
   5. Ensure the program is regularly tested and remains relevant to the scope and complexity of the Credit Union’s operations;   
         
   6. Brief the Board of Directors of the Credit Union at least annually on the status of the program;   
         
   7. Monitor national and international news sources to be aware of potential threats, including resources devoted to national health care issues;   
         
   8. Identify key points of contact for emergency services and critical vendors; and   
         
   9. Assess the potential implications for the Credit Union if a disaster event occurs.  
         
3. **PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS**. Business Continuity is the practice of asking “What if...?” questions and then creating plans and making preparations to address them. The Credit Union Business Continuity Planning process is designed to address one (or more) of three basic event types: Facility, Systems, and People. The planning assumptions for each of these event types are as follows:     
     

   1. In a **Facility** event, our normal place of business is either unavailable or inaccessible.  
         
   2. In a **Systems** event, the technology and/or infrastructure that support our critical business functions is either unavailable or impaired.  
         
   3. In a **People** event, a significant segment of the employee population (up to 50%) is either unavailable or incapacitated, or at risk of becoming so due to the nature of the event, for an extended length of time (8 to 12 weeks). This event category includes mass casualty and pandemic events, as well as events that impact a smaller segment of the employee population.     
       

2. **BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROGRAM**. The management team of the Credit Union will prepare and maintain a Business Continuity Program. The program will include (at a minimum) the following elements:  
     

   1. **Business Continuity Policy** \- details the planning assumptions, framework, organizational responsibility, resources, oversight and governance for the Credit Union Business Continuity Program.    
         
   2. **Business Impact Analysis** \- identifies and prioritizes the business functions performed by the Credit Union in order to provide a foundation for the Business Continuity Planning process. This process is divided into three discrete steps: Business Process identification and Workflow, Identification of Process Dependencies, and Impact Scoring and determination of Maximum Allowable Downtimes.    
         
   3. **Business Continuity Plan** \- provides resumption or recovery processes for each of the three basic event types for which the Credit Union plans (Facility, Systems, and People), including Task Checklists (by event type), Workgroup Recovery planning for Facility events, and Business Process Summaries for each identified Business Process. These summaries include BIA scoring, Recovery Time and Recovery Point Objectives, and high-level Recovery Strategies, Considerations, and Resource Needs (by event type).    
         
   4. **Systems Recovery Planning** (if the Credit Union has an internal IT Management team) \- details the technical processes used to restore impacted Credit Union systems following an interruption or disaster event.   
         
   5. **Incident Management** \- identifies the Roles and Responsibilities, roadmap, and resources used in the Credit Union Incident Management process, including process flowcharts, contact lists for the Incident Management Team and key Vendors, detailed guidance on critical elements of the Incident Management process, and resources used to support emergency operations at the Credit Union.    
         
   6. **Plan Validation and Maintenance** \- evaluates and validates completed plans through various forms of exercises (Orientation/Walkthrough, Tabletop, Functional, and Scaled) and provides a mechanism for reviewing and updating plan content (at a minimum) annually or as business processes, facilities, systems, or people change.      
         
   7. **Risk Assessment** \- evaluates the planning assumptions for the general incident categories utilized in the BIA (facility, systems, and people) using various, more specific, potential business disruption (threat) scenarios, analyzing and prioritizing the severity of each based on their potential impact and probability of occurrence, and performs a Gap Analysis that compares mitigation elements already in place to policies, procedures, and solutions that could be implemented to further mitigate the prioritized threat.     
       

2. **REVIEW**. The Board will (at a minimum) annually review and approve the Business Continuity Program activity and relevant documentation.    
      
3. **TESTING**. The Credit Union is in a constant state of growth and change. The Business Continuity Plan must be tested regularly to ensure that it remains viable. The plan will be tested (at a minimum) annually and the results of each test will be kept at least until the next regulatory examination.   
      
4. **TRAINING AND AWARENESS**. The Credit Union will develop and deliver annual training and awareness programs and materials covering Business Continuity fundamentals, strategies, preparedness and Business Continuity Program documentation for employees, management, board members, and volunteers.  
      
5. **DISASTER DECLARATION AUTHORITY**. The Management Team serves as the decision-making authority for Credit Union. This group includes the Credit Union's Chief Executive Officer, who has disaster declaration authority for the organization, and the , who can assume the decision-making role if the CEO is not available or becomes incapacitated.    
      
6. **EMERGENCY OPERATING POLICIES**. In the event a disaster is declared at the Credit Union, the following policies will become effective and remain in force until the Disaster Declaration is rescinded:     
     

   * Chain of Command (See Policy 2191)    
   * Emergency Powers (See Policy 2192)   
   * Pandemic Preparedness & Response (See Policy 2195\)  
      

2. **DECISION MAKING PRIORITIES**. The following decision-making priorities are used as a guide for the Business Continuity Team. They are intended to provide direction in a potentially high stress environment where specific direction from the Board may not be available. The Board acknowledges the fact that each disaster event is unique and impossible to predict. These general principles can be applied across the broad spectrum of potential disasters.  
     

   1. **Human Safety.** The first priority of the Credit Union is the safety of the staff and volunteers. This concern also extends to members or others who may be affected by a disaster at a credit union facility. The Business Continuity Team shall act before, during, and after a disaster to protect and preserve the life and safety of these individuals.  
         
   2. **Long-Term Recovery. **The next priority is the long-term survival of the Credit Union. Decisions made concerning immediate recovery, reconstruction, or restoration of service must always be made in the context of the long-term recovery of the Credit Union. Immediate results must not be achieved at the expense of the long-term survival of the Credit Union.  
         
   3. **Meeting Member Needs.** The next priority is to meet the needs of the Credit Union's members. Once human safety concerns are met and keeping long-term survival in mind, the Credit Union should do whatever it can to meet the needs of members. For localized disaster events that only impact the Credit Union, this may mean applying all available resources to quickly restore vital member services. For larger, regional disaster events, this may mean providing assistance in the form of special loan programs, assisting members in applying for emergency assistance, etc.  
         
   4. **Prudence**. In all actions during a disaster event, the Business Continuity Team, the staff, and the Board and volunteers must act with prudence. Every effort should be made to understand the ramifications of decisions. Individual needs must be balanced with the needs of the organization and its members.
