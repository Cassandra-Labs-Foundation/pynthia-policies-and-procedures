# Charitable Donation Accounts

### 1) Purpose & Authority

This policy authorizes and governs Pynthia’s use of **Charitable Donation Accounts (CDAs)** to fund charitable giving while complying with **12 CFR §721.3(b)(2)(i)–(vii)**. When a CDA meets all §721.3(b)(2) conditions, its investments are **not limited by Part 703**. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 2) Scope

Applies to all CDA structures (**segregated custodial account** or **special-purpose entity/trust**), all related vendors (trustees, managers), and all directors, committee members, officers, and staff involved in CDA governance, operations, accounting, and reporting. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 3) Key Definitions

* **CDA:** Hybrid charitable/investment vehicle that satisfies §721.3(b)(2)(i)–(vii). ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Qualified Charity:** Organization exempt under **IRC §501(c)(3)** **or §501(c)(19)** (war veterans’ organizations). ([NCUA](https://ncua.gov/files/agenda-items/charitable-donation-accounts-final-rule-20231116.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Total Return:** Actual rate of return (interest, dividends, distributions, realized gains) **excluding fees/expenses** provided they were **not paid to the CU or its affiliates**. ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/12/19/2013-30103/charitable-donation-accounts?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Distribution in Kind:** The **credit union’s acceptance** of remaining CDA assets at termination **in their original form** (not cash) **but only if** those assets are otherwise permissible FCU investments under the Act/Part 703. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Net Worth / Book Value:** As reported under GAAP/Call Report; **Net Worth** is the denominator for the 5% cap; **Book Value** is the cap’s numerator. ([GovInfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2025-title12-vol7/pdf/CFR-2025-title12-vol7-sec721-2.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Affiliate:** Any entity in which the CU has any direct/indirect ownership interest (employee-benefit funding exception noted in rule). ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 4) Governance & Responsibilities

**Board of Directors**

* Adopts and **annually reviews** this policy; approves the CDA agreement, **named Qualified Charities**, investment strategy & risk limits, distribution cadence, funding levels, and vendors; receives quarterly reports and escalates material issues as needed. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**ALCO (Finance)**

* Monitors cap compliance and performance **monthly**; provides **quarterly** reports to the Board; **escalates breaches within 2 business days**.

**Management**

* **CFO (CDA Administrator):** Day-to-day oversight, vendor coordination, distributions, reporting; maps CDA to Call Report (**Account 789H**) and validates cap and total-return calculations. ([NCUA](https://ncua.gov/files/publications/regulations/call-report-instructions-march-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Controller:** GAAP accounting, cap testing, reconciliations.
* **Compliance/Risk:** Regulatory watch, conflicts review, third-party due diligence, quarterly validation of cap calculations.
* **Internal Audit:** Annual control testing and remediation follow-up; coordinates the **annual independent audit** review of CDA balances and activity (as part of the financial statement audit).

### 5) Structure & Documentation

* **Segregation & labeling:** CDA assets must be held in a **segregated custodial account** or **SPE/trust** and clearly labeled “Charitable Donation Account.” ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Regulated trustee/manager:** If a trust is used, the trustee must be regulated by **OCC/SEC/other federal/state** financial regulator. Any non-CU manager with investment discretion must be an **SEC-registered investment adviser** or OCC-regulated. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 6) Funding Limits & Monitoring

* **Regulatory hard cap:** The **aggregate book value** of all CDAs must be **≤5% of net worth at all times**, measured **each quarterly Call Report cycle**; if breached, **cure within 30 days**. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Internal buffer:** Pynthia sets an internal limit of **4% of net worth** (Board may amend).
* **Monitoring cadence:** **Monthly** cap testing and performance review; **quarterly** Board reporting.
* **Call Report mapping:** Report CDA assets at **Account 789H** (“Amounts in assets to fund Charitable Donation Accounts”), per current Call Report instructions. ([NCUA](https://ncua.gov/files/publications/regulations/call-report-instructions-march-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 7) Investment Strategy & Risk Limits

When all §721.3(b)(2) conditions are met, CDA investments are **not constrained by Part 703**; nonetheless, Pynthia adopts quantified, Board-approved limits for safety & soundness. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Strategy & Limits (default parameters; Board may tune):**

* **Permissible classes:** Public equities/funds, investment-grade debt, diversified alternatives (e.g., REITs/commodities), and other Board-approved assets consistent with liquidity/valuation needs.
* **Single-issuer concentration:** ≤ **15%** of CDA assets.
* **Sector concentration:** ≤ **25%** of CDA assets.
* **Liquidity floor:** ≥ **10%** in cash/cash-equivalents.
* **Volatility band:** Target **≤20%** annualized standard deviation (monitor ex-post).
* **Maximum rolling 12-month drawdown:** **≤25%** (default; Board-set).
* **Valuation methods:** **Regular independent assessments** commensurate with asset class and materiality.
* **Conflicts/fees:** The CDA **must not** pay fees/expenses to Pynthia or its affiliates (preserves “Total Return”). ([Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/12/19/2013-30103/charitable-donation-accounts?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 8) Charity Eligibility & Giving Rules

* **Eligibility:** Distributions only to **Qualified Charities** (**501(c)(3)** or **501(c)(19)**), with **annual verification** of tax-exempt status; retain EIN and current IRS evidence. ([NCUA](https://ncua.gov/files/agenda-items/charitable-donation-accounts-final-rule-20231116.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Minimum distribution:** Distribute **≥51% of the CDA’s Total Return** to Qualified Charities **no less frequently than every five (5) years**, **and again at CDA termination**; within each ≤5-year window, timing is at the CU’s discretion. Pynthia’s cadence: **Annual in December**. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Named Charities Schedule:** Board-approved list aligned to mission areas (e.g., financial literacy and education, community development & affordable housing, veterans’ services, youth development & scholarships). Evidence of tax status retained.

### 9) Accounting, Reporting & Records

* **GAAP accounting:** For funding, income/expenses, distributions, unrealized items (if applicable), and termination; document the **Total Return** methodology. **Monthly reconciliations** required; **annual independent audit** covers CDA balances and activity. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* **Board/ALCO reporting (quarterly):** Cap utilization; performance (since inception and current window); **51% distribution coverage**; distributions made/scheduled; **policy variances**; vendor status.
* **Call Report:** Record CDA assets at **Account 789H** per NCUA Form 5300 instructions (current cycle). Retain CDA records for **7 years** (unless law/regulator requires longer). ([NCUA](https://ncua.gov/files/publications/regulations/call-report-instructions-march-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 10) Third-Party Risk Management

Before onboarding and annually thereafter, perform due diligence on any trustee/manager: **regulatory status (OCC/SEC/state), Form ADV/disciplinary history, information security (e.g., SOC 2/ISO), BCP/DR testing, financial condition, performance, fees, conflicts, and exit terms**. Contracts will include **90-day termination notice** and asset-transfer procedures. Where a non-CU manager has discretion, confirm **SEC RIA** status (or OCC-regulated). ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 11) Internal Controls & Compliance Testing

* **Controls:** Segregation of duties; dual approvals for distributions (≥$5,000); monthly reconciliation; automated cap checks; quarterly valuation review; quarterly **Compliance** validation of cap calculations; COI attestations.
* **Testing:** Internal Audit annually tests design/effectiveness and tracks remediation to closure with Board visibility.

### 12) Termination

Board may terminate a CDA at its discretion or upon vendor default, policy breach, or strategic need. On termination: (a) make any **final charitable distribution** required to satisfy the **≥51%** rule for the closing period; (b) receive remaining assets **in cash**, or **in-kind only** if those assets are otherwise permissible FCU investments; (c) execute a **member/stakeholder communications plan** (public-relations) appropriate to the circumstances. ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 13) Training & Policy Maintenance

Management provides **annual training** to involved staff; Board and ALCO receive an **annual regulatory update** briefing. The Board **reviews and re-adopts** this policy at least annually and upon material regulatory change (e.g., amendments to §721.3). ([eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-VII/subchapter-A/part-721/section-721.3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
