# Compliance

#### Patrick's Requirements

* [ ] Goverance. How does it flow from Board to the people doing the work. Compliance should have a direct link to the Board that does not route through the executive.&#x20;
* [ ] Scope of laws that are applicable for this policy
* [ ] Responsibilities under governance.&#x20;
* [ ] Training. Every employee must be trained on compliance because it's a requirement from every regulator. We need to set out what the standards are, not necessarily the training policy. Remedial training can be assigned by the compliance team.&#x20;
* [ ] Audit and assurance reviews. External audit needs to come in usually every year and review the compliance system. Actually they will review the assurance reviews I.E. what has the compliance team reviewed over the past 12 months and can we replicate the findings (if they don't find problems then they are not looking hard enough).&#x20;
* [ ] Review timeline. Clearly stating the review cadence.&#x20;



This is mostly going to be a boilerplate thing to show that we have a good governance process&#x20;
