// BSA case management — the chain the gate's alerts have never had.
//
// core.case has been fully shaped since the first migration (status machine,
// type, sar_decision_timer, evidence, summary) and has never had a writer, so
// every alert CG-LGTXN-01 / CG-STR-01 / CG-STR-02 raised was a dead end: a real
// detection nobody could triage, escalate or decide on.
//
// This is deliberately the FIRST subsystem built, and it is the one that needs
// no fabricated data at all. Its trigger is bsa_alert.created, which the core
// already emits from real money movement through the real gate — a $12k
// transfer really happened and really tripped the threshold. Everything after
// it is real too. That is what makes it the right place to prove the
// provenance machinery works before anything depends on that machinery being
// correct.
//
// BSA-06: alerts triaged within 2 business days; unresolved ones escalate to a
//         case; cases reach a SAR/no-SAR decision within 30 days of detection
//         (60 where there is no suspect).
// BSA-07: the filing decision itself, and do-not-file decisions documented.
//
// WHO MAY DO THIS. Not partners. BSA case management is the chartered credit
// union's obligation, not a fintech's, and SAR confidentiality means a partner
// must not even learn that a case exists. Every endpoint here is closed to
// `partner` actors and a partner asking about a case gets 404, never 403.
